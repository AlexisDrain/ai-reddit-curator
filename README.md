# Claude-Reddit-Curator  
 
We use Claude to rerank content from reddit.

That way you can see the best of the best (posts that are awe-inspiring, laugh-out-loud hilarious, or weirdly educational) while avoiding the worst (ragebait, doomscroll'y, or just plain stupid)

Another advantage that we have over reddit is that we can grab the best content over a longer time horizon (the reddit api lets us crawl posts that are up to two months old), rather than constantly displacing them with newer posts




# To Do's

1. Show Claude images and comments
2. make a test set
3. make the website better (e.g. at least have a compelling screenshot with real posts)
