    "selftext": "Finished project shown, followed by concept-to-reality progress photos! \n\n[Pardon my other attempts at posting this! I learned today I have NO CLUE how to use Reddit! \ud83e\udd78]\n\nI posted about my progress with this beautiful fiery Bulgarian Squares blanket a few months ago. I conceived it back in March, made a plan/shopped/started it in April, and finished all stitching/joining/weaving by July. I have regularly been sleeping under it. But I took my sweet time blocking the border \ud83d\ude42! Knowing I\u2019d finally see its intended recipient today (8/21/24), I blocked the border this past weekend and finished finished FINISHED it.\n\nThe whole thing. IT EXISTS. IT IS WHOLE. There was nothing and now there\u2019s this. What?!?! What a trip!\n\nThe pride and joy I get from seeing/feeling/folding/showing this piece of work is greater than I could have imagined. The only things that changed from my original vision were how to join and border it (which was always going to have to be experimental!), and addition of a dark red layer. I couldn\u2019t have anticipated how profoundly impressed I\u2019d be by my own finished product. I am so happy!!! And instead of feeling sad at its loss when I gifted it today (to my extremely surprised and grateful friend), I felt such relief to see it go where it was meant to.\n\nI can\u2019t wait to make the EXACT same blanket in other colors \ud83d\ude02. I hope to moonlight as a pattern queen sometime and detail every stitch of my process so others can easily put one together. If/when that happens, I will post about it \ud83d\ude0b!\n\nThanks y\u2019all, for being so encouraging and kind. The world needs ya\n\nLink to the video where I learned Bulgarian Squares and adapted from there\u2026s:\nhttps://youtu.be/4I1KbQWtdBU?si=YG-J_q86GB1Wc_op",

    "selftext": "So, this is going to be long and I will try to include the details best I can. This happened a month ago and it's still echoing in my head.\n\nWhen I (26F) was 21, I was in an abusive+toxic relationship with a man we'll call Mitch (fake name, 35M at the time), Mitch was friends with this guy, who we'll call Shawn (fake name, 38 at the time/a recovering alcoholic). Shawn always gave me bad vibes. I had known that Mitch met Shawn in jail, but I never pried about why he was there. Mitch told me that he himself was in jail for a bar fight, I was dumb and believed him. A few months into the relationship, I got pregnant, but ultimately, lost the baby. It was around this time my parents started hearing rumors about Mitch. They asked me his birthday and full name, and turns out, he was a registered sex offender, and did time for child p*rnography. I left him immediately, and even looked at the registry myself. Not much of a surprise that I found Shawn listed, mugshot and all, also for minor related incidents. \n\nI have since moved in, and am happily married in a completely different county. Last week, my husband and I were visiting family in my hometown, when we came across Shawn in a store. We did our best to avoid him, and yet, he walked right up to me and my husband WHILE we were at checkout, and had the nerve to ask me \"Where's the kid?\" knowing damn well I had a miscarriage all those years ago. I saw red. It was in that moment, I realized he was there with a woman, who was with two special needs adults (both female).\n\n I saw the rings, and I asked her, \"How could you trust a man like that around them?\" because it was very clear that both were non verbal, as they could barely even call her mom. \n\n Shawn immediately got tense, and his wife asked me what I meant. So I told her. This resulted in her googling the registry, and proceeding to walk out of the store with her daughters in tow. Luckily, my husband stepped in before Shawn could say anything else. I've heard from the grapevine that she has started the divorce proceedings, and now Shawn has started drinking again.\n\nI brought this up with someone, and they said there was better ways to go about this than how it happened, but I don't know. I just need an outside opinion. ",
