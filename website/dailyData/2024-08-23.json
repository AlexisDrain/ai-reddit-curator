    "title": "I broke my Boss using Microsoft Outlook Delayed Email",
    "selftext": "Longish story so I will try to keep it short. New job, new boss, old problems.\n\nShe's one of those super aggressive types that wants to be CEO before she is 45 so she's doing it on the backs of the entire team. I'm close to retirement. I give zero phucks. Her MO is to send emails all day asking &amp; expecting an immediate response. She sometimes emails up until midnight, and starts again always after 7AM. So I figured she is a Midnight to 7AM sleeper. She has three kids, a 9 year old, a 12, and a 17. The 17 year old kid has most of her attention her right now because of 17 year old girl drama. No further explanation needed.\n\nSo Outlook has a function when you can delay sending an email to a set time. So for the last month I have been selecting certain emails to be delayed-sent at set times, beginning at 11:30PM, 11:47 PM, 11:58PM, 12:01AM, 12:07AM, 12:15AM, 1AM, 2:30AM, so on a so forth. \n\nI am bracketing the time I know she is winding down getting ready for bed and trying to fall asleep. My goal is to spin her up on random days via email so she can't get to sleep easily.\n\nI don't do it to all of my emails, just the random emails I need to send her during the day when I am the topic starter, and usually random subjects like: \"Hey I noticed we are overspending New Business Funds by 17% on this project, but we could reduce that spend by 3% by switching to using one of the interns who get paid less than Barbara, who is paid more.\"\n\nThese emails trigger her because I know she is super sensitive about budget overspend and also older workers who cost her more to use. She usually can't not answer. And I know she leaves her smartphone on next to her bed, and won't silence it. My goal is to deny her sleep and to spin her up all night long so she can't get back to sleep. I know her husband (informally via a co-worker) and he told him that he's been sleeping in a spare bedroom because she won't silence her phone and it \"dings\" all night with emails. \n\nThat's me.\n\nSo, these delayed emails I am sending, she can't figure out if I am using delayed send or not (The IT team works for me, so they aren't helping her) but the lack of sleep is starting to make her crack. She asked me last week if I am working all night. I told her the wife and I are getting a divorce so I am so depressed that I bury myself in work all night and doze in my office chair at home. I don't actually. I'm in bed hugging the wife and sleeping like a baby from 10PM to 7AM. Except for certain days when I like to awake at 4-5AM and go for a walk or jog in the early morning.\n\nYesterday during a staff meeting she dozed off right in the middle of the meeting. She just nodded off almost in mid sentence. All of us in the room stopped talking while she snored softly for about 4 minutes and then popped awake. Nobody said a word. While she was dozing I sent her a delayed email set to arrive at 12:05 AM tonight.\n\nI'm awake right now. It's 5AM. I've been sending her live emails for the last hour. She's responding. She's losing her mind right now, I can tell from the tone of her emails.\n\nHappy Friday Gwen\n\n\"Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.\" Galatians VI. One of my favorite bible passages.",

    "title": "Completely delete a client company's website and email services? Are you sure? Ok.",
    "selftext": "This happened a few years ago, so details are a bit fuzzy and chat is paraphrased.\n\nI was T2 tech support for a company that handles my country's largest ISP's entire professional email services, all its DNS management services, and a large portion of its website building and web hosting services. This company is tiny, minute, not even a blip in the radar, but has power that I will likely never again hold at my fingertips.\n\nOne day, a ticket comes in from ISP. Big client company is moving away from our proprietary email services and into Microsoft 365, or some such equivalent change. This usually meant I got to help the client through the process of changing DNS records, migrating inboxes or just backing up emails, and even actually setting up some stuff on the Microsoft side (technically not my job, but the ISP's T1 tech support was woefully untrained for anything even remotely technical, and terribly unprepared for most things merely commercial, and my company was awesome and treated me right).\n\nSo, ticket: \n\nISP: Client is moving from service X to service Y.  Please remove their subscription from the database.\n\nMe: There seems to be some sort of mistake (which was very common). We remove them from there once the new service is set up and running. Otherwise, it will delete everything in their subscribed package, including all email storage, DNS records, and website. You likely want to change their subscription to not include email services, but keep the rest, since your Microsoft subscription doesn't include DNS and web hosting management. And even that change only after they have their new email service set up.\n\nISP: yaddayadda confirm remove their subscription.\n\nMe: Are you absolutely sure? This process is not recoverable. All their emails, DNS records, and entire website, including database, *will be permanently deleted*.\n\nISP: Request has been submitted. Remove subscription.\n\nAt this point, it's been a couple of days since the first ticket, so I call my boss over (absolutely wonderful guy and extremely intelligent), and tell him what they're asking me to do.\n\nBoss: Alright, let's show them they pay us because we know things and they don't. Don't delete the subscription, but suspend all the services that would be affected. Keep those tickets at hand and expect a phone call. If they call you, tell them to talk to me.\n\nGod that felt good. I mean, I felt bad for the client, because their entire company basically shut down for an afternoon, but when they called my work phone directly from ISP (uncommon, usually just for emergencies) and the nice lady asked me what had happened with Client in that tone that says \"I'm doing my best to hear all sides before making a decision but I am freaking the hell out right now\", and I directed her to the tickets where I very clearly stated what would happen if I did what they told me to, and then told her to call Boss, I felt so vindicated. Boss later told me to let them sweat for a couple of hours, because the process should have been \"unrecoverable\", and then turn the services back on.\n\nISP was, yet again, absolutely thrilled with us, and my name kept coming up even more often as the person that solves things.",

I said no so my mom suggested that I would instead of tossing the bouquet I would go and give it to her like on tiktok and he would propose. I said no\n\nMy mom got angry when I still said please no, because this suggestion would be at the end of my party anyway. And wouldn\u2019t steal from my party.\n\nI am not good at writing these things so I am sorry if I am leaving out plenty but I can\u2019t stop crying. Aitah? Sometimes I feel that I am sometimes I feel I am not.\n\nI want to stay anonymous so I will not be answering questions about my location or names\n\n**Additional Information from OOP on growing up with her sister at their parents\u2019 house**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Yes. I have never had a birthday of my own growing up. Always my sister too would get a cake candles and gifts.\n&gt; \n&gt; Then people refused to buy gifts for both so my parents divided the gifts between us.\n&gt; \n&gt; When I was 12 my aunt was very angry that they gave her gift to my sister instead of me. So next birthday they hid all the gifts from other people and gave them to me after the party without my sister\u2019s knowledge because people refused to share the gifts between us. That was my last birthday that I celebrated until I moved out. I told them I didn\u2019t want birthdays nor gifts anymore just pancakes for breakfast.\n\n**Relevant Comments**\n\n**pnut0027:** If I was a woman and my bf proposed to me at my sisters (or anyone\u2019s) wedding, that would be a swift no in front of everyone who matters to him.\n&gt; \n&gt; **OOP:** It was something she showed interest in and her bf \u201cgot the gesture \u201c\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; **round_robin959903:** Wait... Your sister wants her bf to propose at your wedding? I mean, I'm already on your side and you're NTA.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; **OOP:** That\u2019s what I understood from my mom. I asked her why they would even think my sister wants to be proposed to like that and she said that she has shown and hinted to her bf that she would love that because everyone would witness it\n\n**OOP on if her sister is younger than her and if their mother is calling the sister her favorite one**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** She is 3 years younger yes\n+\n&gt; Ih no I have always known she is the favorite. But now they aren\u2019t even denying it\n\n**Pale-Wishbone5635:** Get your husband to say in his speech how pleased he that his beautiful wife is getting her special day and anyone planning on spoiling that by announcing babies, proposing or even just football results can leave now! Then he will look like an AH if he does it. Also make sure the bouquet goes anywhere but to your sister. And prime the DJ to switch the mic off if he tries. You need to fight fire with fire. Also, kick them out if they do it. Have security ready!\n\n**SubstantialAgency2:** NTA, just cancel the wedding, waste their money, save, and pay for yourself. Do it your way.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I can\u2019t cancel the wedding. It would be very disrespectful for everyone who took the time and effort to attend. My friends and family. My husband\u2019s family. I love these people you know. Not my mom and my sister\u2019s bf very much at the moment though.\n\n**OOP on if there would be open mic at the wedding and responds to preventing the proposal from happening**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** No, but besides the MOH and bestman and parents, it is \u201cfree mic\u201d. And I guess my mother would call him up is the plan\n\n+\n\n&gt; We are definitely canceling free mic\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/H9vFHgUnKV): **August 15, 2024**\n\nNew reader, please check my first post.\n\nHi! I am sorry for not updating earlier. This is my update. My husband and I read all the comments to my post and I want to thank you for your indignation on our behalf. Then my husband said that this probably would be the reaction everywhere, not only on my post. So we decided them embarrassing themselves was the best punishment. We decided to, well fuck it. I am marrying my best friend, nothing else matters.\n\nI ignored my family for the rest of that week, up until my wedding the and I was busy anyway. I saw them first at my wedding. My mother made her speech then she asked my (I guess future brother in law now) to join her. He proposed and literally 2 or 3 clapped beside my mother, sister and . The rest looked like the meme girl (side eyeing chloe) so my husband was right. After the awkwardness, the rest of the evening was amazing. I spent it with my husband and close friends.\n\nMy sister, fianc\u00e9 and mom sat sulking for the rest of the night because I don\u2019t think anyone went to congratulate them. Mom sent me a text later asking if I sabotaged it I didn\u2019t answer because like leave me alone I am on my honeymoon, I don\u2019t want drama but also I don\u2019t care what she believes, I will bot explain myself. It is not my problem how little self awareness they have that they don\u2019t even understand that what they did was actually frowned upon by normal people.\n\nThank you\n\n**Relevant Comments**\n\n**MattDaveys:** Imagine the memory of your proposal being a group of people just side eyeing you, no celebration or happiness at all from them.\n\nNo matter what happens she\u2019ll never be able to change that. Ain\u2019t karma a bitch.\n\n**jadechemicalinsomnia:** the wedding guests understood the assignment\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# **DO NOT COMMENT IN LINKED POSTS OR MESSAGE OOPs \u2013 BoRU Rule #7**\n\n# **THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT OOP**",

    "selftext": "My (25M) world turned upside down two years ago when I found out that my mother (48F) had been having an affair with one of her coworkers (50M). My parents had been married for nearly 30 years, and I always thought they had the perfect relationship. They were the couple that everyone in the neighborhood admired\u2014a true team, or so I believed.\n\nOne day, my dad (50M) sat me and my younger sister (20F) down and told us that he and Mom were getting a divorce. I was shocked and devastated. My dad is a quiet man, always the steady presence in our lives, and seeing the pain in his eyes broke me. He didn\u2019t go into details at first, but a few weeks later, after I pressed him, he admitted that Mom had been unfaithful.\n\nI was furious, heartbroken, and felt utterly betrayed. My mom tried to explain herself, saying that she and my dad had grown apart and that she had found \"love\" again. But all I could see was the destruction she had left in her wake. My dad was a shell of the man he once was, and my sister struggled to cope with the fallout, turning to therapy and cutting off almost all contact with Mom.\n\nFast forward to a month ago: My mom announced that she was getting remarried to the man she had cheated with. She expected me to be happy for her, even asked me to walk her down the aisle since my sister refused. The idea of celebrating their union, after everything it destroyed, made me sick to my stomach. I told her flat-out that I wouldn\u2019t be attending the wedding.\n\nShe was furious, called me ungrateful and unsupportive, and accused me of being childish. She said that I was choosing sides and that she deserved to be happy. But I can\u2019t shake the image of my dad, alone and broken, trying to rebuild his life while she gets her happily ever after with the man who ruined ours.\n\nMy extended family is split. Some say I should go to keep the peace and support my mom, while others say they understand why I\u2019m refusing. My dad hasn\u2019t weighed in much, but I know deep down that my absence would mean a lot to him.\n\nI can\u2019t help but feel conflicted, though. Am I being too harsh? Should I just swallow my pride and attend for the sake of family unity? Or am I justified in standing my ground?\n\nAITA?",
