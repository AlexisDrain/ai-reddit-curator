    "title": "The most infuriating aspect of Concord",
    "selftext": "Many people who have played the game agree that the game is \"solid, competent\" but \"bland, derivative, generic, etc.\" as well. But I would argue that the debut trailer is the worst thing about it.\n\nSony beat everyone else to the internet with their State of Play to kick off the Summer games announcements. And to kick off that State of Play? A long, drawn out trailer for Concord.\n\nInitially, I thought it looked cool. Futuristic setting, quirky characters, maybe we're putting together a team and trotting across the galaxy on a memorable adventure? Maybe some GOTG mixed in with some Mass Effect? Those were the vibes I was getting. \n\nOf course we got confirmation by the devs immediately after that the game was instead a 5v5 hero shooter. And all I could think of is:\n\n\"Can I please have the last 5 minutes of my life back? K thx\"\n\nThis trailer failed for two reasons (in my opinion).\n\n1. Expectations. This one's the most obvious one. I think the vast majority of us agree: this trailer alluded to something other than what it is. I saw a trailer with a few misfits having some character moments, some banter about a \"plan\", an altercation and a \"tug o war\" with some macguffin. Not exactly setting the stage for a hero shooter if you ask me.\n\n2. Cost. How much do you think they wasted on this trailer? Likely millions. It's a high value production that must have required alot of time and money to produce. Those resources could have been used on the game itself. I don't know what aspect of the game could have used the resources mind you, since the game is fundamentally a copy paste of other franchises. But more development resources could have went into separating the game from the rest of the crowd. It would have been wiser to show off a much shorter, in-game trailer showcasing a match instead of what we got.\n\nI don't know about you, but I think the trailer exemplifies what's wrong with alot of these showcases. Big, bombastic cinematics for games that are nothing like the trailers. I've seen enough of this shit over the last 10 years, and it's kind of hard to be enthusiastic for these big gaming events because of it. I don't go into Nintendo Directs with the same apathy, because what you see is what you get with those guys. I wish the rest of the industry would read the room and take notes.",

Upon arrival, establish an understood and easily findable \"rally point\".  Usually a easily identifiable landmark like a fountain or a particular ride,etc.  This is the agreed upon point to return to if for any reason the group is split up and can't find each other.  Waiting until every is scattered at a loud concert and trying to call each other on cellphones and figure out where everyone is, is less then ideal.  2.  It may sound a little silly but have a \"family noise\"  .  In our family if we are in public and we hear a loud Hootie-Whooo (sound inspired by Outkast lol) we know that a family member is looking for us and/or trying to get our attention. ",

    "selftext": "My wife and I are staying with my mom and doing everything we can to get out. I already feel like shit and don't need to be shamed for it. \n\nMy mom despises my wife, like I can see the hatred in her eyes. It is a bit scary actually. She isn't too fond of me either these days.\n\nMy wife had a birthday recently and I didn't get her a gift beyond flowers. I felt bad but our priority has to be saving right now. Her mom however did sent a Tiffany's bracelet. It really brightened her day. However my mom came downstairs and saw the box and just jumped to the conclusion that I had bought it, and began screaming that how dare I spend money like that while living in her house.\n\nI tried to correct her but I couldn't talk over her screaming. She then told her fiance to keep us away from her and burst into tears. He went after her and they were in the room for about an hour. I did walk past at one point and hear her crying, but tbh I felt like she could cry if she wanted to jump at conclusions and scream at me like that. \n\nFinally she came out and I told her that MIL bought the bracelet. She didn't say anything but her fiance blew up about what is wrong with me and why would I let her cry like that. Honestly I don't feel that bad. She chose to assume something and react like a crazy person\n\nAdditional info\n\nThis was a one time incident. My mom makes it clear she hates us living here but she isn\u2019t mentally ill. She isn\u2019t a threat. She had one singular breakdown after holding in her feelings for a long time\n\nMy wife chooses to live here. She is an active participant in our decisions and agrees this is our best opportunity \n\nWe can\u2019t live with mil as she lives on the other side of the country ",
