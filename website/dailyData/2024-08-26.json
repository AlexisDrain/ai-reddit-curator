    "selftext": "**I am not The OOP, OOP is u/milchickenpox** \n\n**Mother-in-law [56F] deliberately infected my [27F] daughter [1F] with chickenpox. I'm livid. She doesn't think it's a big deal.** \n\n**TRIGGER WARNING:** &gt;!emotional manipulation, spousal neglect, child abuse, abusive behavior, child endangerment!&lt; \n\n[Original Post](https://www.rareddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3ym168/motherinlaw_56f_deliberately_infected_my_27f/)  **Dec 29, 2015** \n\nI can hardly type this out because thinking about it makes me so angry. \n\nEarlier this year my husband [31M] and I decided to spend Christmas with his family for the first time since my daughter was born last September. Since they live 12 hours away, we decided to stay for a few weeks before Christmas so they could spend loads of time with Annie [13 months]. \n\nWe arrived early like we planned and everything was great. I've had a few disagreements with my mother-in-law Trish [56F] in the past over my parenting style (she criticised me for using disposable diapers, buying baby food from the supermarket and not raising Annie as an \"organic\" baby) but everything seemed great. \n\nAfter a day or two settling in my husband and I decided to pick up a few gifts from a mall around an hour away before the last-minute rush kicked in. My father-in-law [60M] tagged along. Trish said she was happy to take care of Annie. \n\nWe got back a few hours later and Annie was down for a nap on a blanket I didn't recognise. Trish said one of her friends dropped by and gave it as an early Christmas gift. It looked pretty old/worn, but I figured one of her hippy friends was just recycling it. \n\nThe next two weeks were fine, aside from Trish making a point to prepare meals for Annie from scratch. I mentioned this to my husband and he said to just let her be. Annie mostly mushed the food Trish gave her with her hands/threw the bowls on the floor, as she's been doing at the moment. Trish said it would \"take her a while to get used to nutritious meals\". \n\nI was getting sick of her meddling but it was only for a few weeks, so for the sake of the holidays I let it slide. \n\nThe day after Christmas Annie was really unsettled and wouldn't stop fidgeting and crying. I took her temperature and she had a fever, so I kept an eye on her for the next few days and it thankfully started to go down. This morning, she started to get a rash and blisters on her arms and legs and I freaked out. \n\nI was packing a bag to drive to see a doctor when Trish asked where I was going. I told her Annie had a rash and I was taking her to see a doctor. \n\nShe got a weird smug smile on her face and told me there was nothing to worry about. When I asked her what she was talking about she said without even looking at Annie that what she had was just Chickenpox. \n\nI asked her how she could possibly know that and she casually admitted one of her friend's grandkids had chickenpox a few weeks ago so she asked them to wipe a blanket over the child's arms, legs and face and bring it to her house. \n\nAt this point I couldn't believe what I was hearing so I asked if that blanket was the \"gift\" Annie was sleeping on. She said it was. \n\nI lost my shit. \n\nTo be honest I don't really remember what I said because I was up most of the night for two days checking on Annie. I just unleashed on Trish asking what the fuck was wrong with her. \n\nMy husband and father-in-law came to try to calm things down and Trish dug in her heels and said chickenpox was \"the best and most natural thing\" for Annie to build up her immunity. I already have a vaccination schedule in place with my paediatrician and she was booked in to get immunised for chickenpox at 18 months. \n\nWe drove to see the doctor and he confirmed she had it. He said I'll have to cut Annie's nails short and might have to tape socks on her hands while she sleeps because kids so young can scratch until they bleed and that will leave scars. \n\nOn the drive back my husband started making excuses for Trish, that she was only doing what she thought was best. I couldn't believe he was defending her and we fought most of the way home until I told him to stop talking to me. \n\nAnnie's been scratching like crazy and I just had to tape socks over her hands. Trish tried to talk to me when we got back and I told her to get out of my sight. \n\nWe were meant to stay until Wednesday but I just finished packing up our stuff so we can leave first thing in the morning. \n\nI'm so angry I can't even think. Whenever I hear Trish moving around in the kitchen my heart starts beating faster and I feel like going out there and grabbing her by the hair. I don't ever want to see her again or let my daughter see her again. \n\nWhat can I say to make her and my husband realise the enormity of what she's done? (I don't think I can speak coherently to their faces until Annie gets better.) \n\n**tl;dr:** Mother-in-law deliberately infected my daughter with chickenpox. I'm so angry I feel like physically harming her. I need advice on what to say to make her realise what she's done. \n\n**RELEVANT COMMENTS** \n\n**When asked why her daughter wasn't vaccinated for chicken pox** \n\n&gt;She's up-to-date on her vaccination schedule.

I read all the comments and messages, and they genuinely helped - especially the home remedies on how to stop itching. \n\nSince my first post was locked and deleted, I hope it's okay to briefly summarise here. \n\n&gt;Over the holidays my mother-in-law Trish [56F] deliberately infected my daughter Annie [1F] with chickenpox by wrapping her in an infected blanket while she was left alone with her for several hours. Trish didn't tell anyone what she had done until Annie came down with a horrible fever and rash. Annie was booked in for her chickenpox vaccination at 18 months but Trish thought what she did is 100 per cent normal, despite the fact it's caused Annie significant pain and distress (and now scarring to her face and arms). \n\n&gt;When I found out what she did I was livid and had a shouting match with her and packed up our things to leave the very next morning. It soon came out my husband Jack didn't think Trish had done anything wrong. \n\nOn to the update. I didn't think it would be possible \u2013 but things got worse. \n\nI got up first thing the next morning and started packing our stuff into the car. Once I opened it up I kept the keys in my pocket since I was going in and out - usually we use Jack's set and leave mine in my bag. While I was packing he sat in the kitchen with Trish and my father-in-law [60M] and chatted and had coffee like nothing was wrong. \n\nAnnie was mercifully still asleep so I'd just gently belted her in and closed her door when Jack came out and asked if I had everything. I said we were good to go as soon as he was. \n\nHe said 'okay' and calmly took out his key set and centrally locked the car, locking Annie in. I asked him what the hell he was doing and he said we wouldn't be leaving until I apologised to Trish. \n\nI think I was stunned into silence because he then took the chance to rehash what he said the previous day: that Trish thought she was doing what was best, that \"chickenpox doesn't kill you\" and that I was \"making a bigger deal out of this\" than I needed to and making Trish feel bad. Yes, making *her* feel bad. \n\nAll the comments from my last post were swirling around in my head, and I told him he needs to stop being a son and start being a father. He screwed up his face and said he would *always* be Trish's son, and that was the point \u2013 that nobody should speak to his mother the way I had the day before, and I needed to apologise to \"clear the air\". \n\nI felt like I had entered some kind of weird Twilight Zone where I had accidentally married a 9-year-old instead of an adult man, so I just asked him to open the car so we could leave. He repeatedly refused, then walked back inside and said he would see me in there when I was \"acting more reasonable\". \n\nYou can probably guess what happened next. I'd left my bag on the passenger seat, so he probably assumed my keys were in there. Nope. I waited 30 seconds, then just hopped into the car and drove away. \n\nMy phone blew up with a million calls from him, Trish, and my father-in-law. Eventually my mom and dad and my sister Jess, who I'm super close with, called as well. I'd briefly texted Jess about what was happening the day before but she was stunned to get the full blow-by-blow. By the time I was on the open road I asked her to phone Jack and tell him he could walk home for all I care. Once she heard my side of the story, and not Jack's (which was apparently that I had gone crazy, frightened Trish, 'snatched' Annie and 'sped away'), she calmed way down. \n\nMom, dad and Jess offered to start driving and meet me half way so I could switch with one of them and wouldn't have to drive the full twelve hours by myself in one day. I was so grateful to see them I pretty much broke down in a truck stop parking lot while I blubbered that I loved them. \n\nThey all took turns driving while I had a rest. It was super reassuring to talk it over and hear that Trish and Jack are the unreasonable ones. Once we got back I stayed at my parents' overnight and they said I could stay as long as I needed. \n\nThe next few days were fairly tense. I was up most of the night making sure Annie didn't scratch (which she did anyway, somehow) and it seemed like she just cried and cried and cried until she was exhausted. She has five scars on her face and a few others on her arms from scratching. I know appearances shouldn't matter, but I'm so angry her skin is marked for life now over some stupid bullshit. This whole thing is just something I never expected to happen. \n\nI answered one of Jack's calls only to have him start a rant that he \"didn't recognise this person I had become\", so I hung up on him. He was due to come back for the start of the work year, which I wasn't looking forward to, but I figured we could make it work as long as Trish was 12 hours away. \n\nThen at like 11pm one night I got a very short and formal text from father-in-law via Jack's phone, saying Trish had come down with shingles and was in the emergency room, that Jack was staying there to care for her, and that he would work from their house remotely once the year started back up. \n\nJack's been there for the past few weeks tending to momma's every whim \u2013 I'm sure she's put on an Oscar-worthy performance of having one foot in the grave \u2013 and according to Google it should be any day now that her painful, crusty pustules go gently into that sweet night. \n\nA few weeks ago I was honestly so tired and overwhelmed and in disbelief that I didn't know what to do. Now I'm back at home with people who actually care about me I think I'm starting to realise how lucky I am to see the weird relationship with his mommy this early on. The fact that he cares more about Trish than his own daughter speaks volumes. When he eventually comes back I think we'll have to have a serious talk about our future together. \n\n**tl;dr:** Mother-in-law infects my 1-year-old with chicken pox on purpose. Husband supports his mommy. He tries to force me to apologise to her by locking our daughter in the car but I peace out with a spare set of keys. Husband has barely spoken to me in the weeks since. Mother-in-law came down with shingles so he's staying with her to nurse her back to health. I don't think any amount of TLC can do the same for our relationship now I've seen the real him. Whew. \n\n**TOP COMMENTS** \n\n**TinaPesto** \n\n&gt;He locked your daughter in the car, holy shit. And assumed you wouldn't be able to get her out -- I mean, that was why he locked her in, to threaten you. Holy shit. \n\n&gt;Good on you for dipping out of there after that. Whatever happens with your marriage moving forward, you seem to have your parenting priorities straight. Good luck, and I hope Annie feels better soon. \n\n**bugsdoingthings** \n\n&gt;&gt;Yeah, this. HE LOCKED A SICK BABY IN THE CAR. Kudos to OP for handling that with a cool head because I would have lost my shit \n\n**Deminix** \n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;That is fucking terrifying behavior out of him. That poor baby is going to grow up with that as a father. \n\n**~** \n\n**SkullBearer** \n\n&gt;You only get shingles if you've had chickenpox, the new vaccine prevents it. Rather ironic. \n\n&gt;I'd get divorce papers served before mummy dearest decides your daughter should become a breatharian or join Scientology. \n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT THE OOP** \n\n**DO NOT CONTACT THE OOP's OR COMMENT ON LINKED POSTS, REMEMBER - RULE 7**",

    "selftext": "I came home the other morning to find my gaming chair completely missing. Whatever I have my old gaming chair not the end of the world. I go to turn on my PC and the MB flashes quickly and nothing. Great. I take a look and find a small piece of damage on the MB. Looks like someone too a screwdriver and snapped off some soldering. Well shit. Later I finally notice two capacitors missing on my MB and they are not in my case or anywhere to be found. I confront the guy and eventually he admits to everything without me mentioning what I noticed was wrong. Great\u2026 call PD, make a report for criminal damage. I buy a new MB. Spend roughly 3 hours taking everything apart and rebuilding it. Go to switch it on and I hear a pop and the system shuts down. \u201cWTF?!\u201d I unplug the Graphics card and boot the system. Everything runs normally, okay great. Plug the PCIE back in and no boot just a flash. I take the GPU apart and he managed to pull a capacitor off of that as well. Once again capacitor is nowhere to be found so it\u2019s obvious he ripped it off. At this point I\u2019m fuming, seconds from an absolute assault on this man. He gives me the keys to the apartment and leaves voluntarily. I go buy a new GPU and finally. Everything boots and runs. \n\nWhy did he do this? He wouldn\u2019t answer that. I guess I\u2019ll find reasoning in court hopefully. We didn\u2019t get into a fight or argument it is seemingly unprovoked at this point.\n\nMoral of the story. Don\u2019t ever help anyone when nobody else will. I give you a place to lay your head, shower, cook, and feel safe and this is how you repay me. Utter POS. \n\nOn the bright side\u2026 I now have a massive upgrade of MB and GPU. And I will be pursuing all legal action for my money spent, items damaged, item stolen, and time spent.\n\nThanks for reading my rant.",

    "selftext": "Throwaway Account\n\nI (42f) divorced my ex-husband \"Chad\" (42m) for cheating with his current wife \"Rebecca\" (30f) a few years back.\n\nI'll spare the details but basically something Chad did set off alarm bells so I did some snooping and discovered a paper trail that led me to Rebecca. I was furious and hurt but instead of confronting him about it then, I waited and collected evidence.\u00a0 I found Rebecca on social media and joined one of the online clubs she was in. We had the same interests so it wouldn't be that be of a red flag if either Chad or Rebecca found out and I just played it cool.\n\nI waited until after our youngest was in school so I could get a part-time job and got Chad to pay for my certification so I could get a better job. During this time he would go on trips, book hotels, buy gifts, etc. with a \"secret\" account that I was able to access because I know Chad well enough to guess his passwords and that he only sets his alerts when someone tries to use it.\n\nAfter I had moved certain things out of the house without his knowledge and convinced him to take his name off of my car, I handed him the divorce papers of the hotel lobby he was in waiting for Rebecca. I had tons of pictures of them together but only showed three of them when he tried to deny and two more to his family when he tried to send them after me. Chad was up for a big promotion so I told him that we could either get this divorce over with or I could kick up a fuss which would make his employers reconsider his position. After I made it clear that I didn't want any alimony and that he could keep his retirement we went our separate ways. Shortly after that Rebecca got pregnant and they got married and she aggravates to no end, but since my kids never complained I was willing to just suck it up.\n\nThen recently, Rebecca decided to get a little arrogant and publicly criticized my parenting because my child didn't do so well at the end of the school year and how she'd raise her child to be \"smart\". In the heat of the moment (along with some built up anger) I lied and said it wasn't very smart of her to tip off the wife that she was the AP. Chad wasn't there, but his mom and sister were and he called me that night to ask about it. He always wondered how I found out and instead of telling the truth I said that Rebecca was the one who tipped me off with the photos and told me when/where they'd be. And for some strange reason Chad asked me to keep our kids for the whole summer which I was willing to do in exchange for getting them on Christmas. I heard a few weeks later that Chad and Rebecca didn't have a very good summer. Rebecca has been messaging constantly about this but if it doesn't have anything to do with my kids I, SILENT MODE. I was talking to my brother about this and he thinks that while it's understandable WHY I lied that it was still wrong, but since I don't care about Rebecca or Chad I have to ask AITA?",
