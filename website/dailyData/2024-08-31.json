    "title": "[Update] Company wanted me to bring Starbucks to the interview ",
    "selftext": "My original post about an interesting job interview situation got a lot of attention, and I wanted to provide some clarifications and updates. Thanks for all your comments and support!\n\nTo recap, I got a call for an entry-level cold calling sales job. After a quick phone interview, they scheduled me for an in-person interview with the owner the next day. The asked me illegal questions and demanded to bring specific coffee order to the interview.\n\nNow, let me fill in some details I didn't mention before. The interviewer, Simon, was also an immigrant. This partly explains his questions about my background. My accent didn't match my name, and my last name was from a region close to where he's from, so he was curious. When I said I was from a completely different region, he asked about my parents, which I didn't answer.\n\nSimon called back to confirm that the owner will be available to attend and said there was a \"problem.\" When I asked what the problem was, he said that I \"owed\" him a coffee and gave me specific instructions: Medium size, cold, no sugar because he was dieting. At first, I thought he was joking, so I played along and asked if I should bring some donuts too. He said no because of high cholesterol. That's when I realized he was serious.\n\nHe repeated that I \"owed\" him this coffee for tomorrow's interview because they had many candidates and he had put in a good word for me. He insisted I shouldn't let him down. It wasn't presented as a general requirement for all candidates, but as a personal debt I needed to repay \u2013 he genuinely expected me to bring him this specific coffee order to the interview.\n\nDespite finding it bizarre, I was desperate enough to consider attending the interview (without coffee, obviously). However, thankfully, I got another job offer this morning from a company I was really looking forward to. I got busy submitting my fingerprints for the background check and completely forgot about Simon's interview.\n\nSimon started calling me after I didn't show up for the interview. I didn't pick up but decided to send him a message explaining I wouldn't be coming. He responded by saying that I'm unprofessional and that I put him in a bad position with the owner (see the screenshot).\n\nI felt the whole situation was more funny than serious. The company is very small, probably less than 5 employees, so I'm not really worried about burning bridges with these clowns, if it was even a real position and not a free coffee scam. That's why I don't think it warrants legal action as some suggested.\n\nHowever, I did find the owner's email in an online directory and sent them the whole story with screenshot. His response was very professional, see the screenshots attached to post. I felt bad for Simon but was concerned his behavior could get the company in serious trouble if he keeps doing that.\n\nIn retrospect, I think Simon was trying to lie to his boss and accidentally exposed himself. While I don't regret my decision, I hope this serves as a learning experience for everyone involved.",

    "title": "AITA For Telling My Pregnant Wife That She Exposed Our Daughter To A Predator?",
    "selftext": "36M here. This has honestly been the most difficult week of my life. Emotions are high, and I am not sure if I'm seeing things clearly. I've been with my wife (35F) since college. We've been married for almost five years and have a three year old daughter together. She's also around five months pregnant right now.\n\nI've always thought my wife's relationship with her family was a bit strange. When we were in college, she asked for her dad's advice/approval on EVERYTHING, even little things like whether she should ask her professor for an extension. Her parents are both intense and controlling at times, and my wife it less influenced by them now than she used to be now that she's older, has her own family, and lives on the other side of the country, but they still get under her skin at times. My wife was also the \"surprise\" baby, and she has two older brothers (nine &amp; seven years older). I'll call the brother who is nine years older \"Tom\" for the sake of this story.\n\nTom has always been a bit odd to me. He's married with no kids, but is very religious and involved heavily with his church. My wife seems to enjoy seeing him at Holidays well enough, but she isn't especially close with him.\n\nOn Monday, my wife called me from her office SOBBING. I asked what was wrong, and she told me Tom was arrested and being charged with possession of child pornography. I was shocked, to say the least. My wife ended up leaving work early, and asked if I would do the same. When I got home, she told me a bit about the charges/how her parents are doing. I asked if she expected this, and she said she was surprised at first, but looking back she should have seen it coming. I asked what she meant, and she proceeded to tell me that when she was in first grade, Tom started coming into her room at night and touching her inappropriately. She said this lasted for a few years, but she doesn't know exactly when it stopped. When she was telling me this, she said it casually, like she was reading something off a menu.\n\nI, on the other hand, was shocked and furious. I told her Tom molested her. My wife said it was uncomfortable, but she never saw it that way, because it's normal for kids to experiment with each other. I said it would be one thing if they were very young and closer in age, but this was a 15+ year old boy and a little girl. I also explained that he did this when her parents went to sleep and told her to keep it between them because he KNEW it was wrong at the time. Also, these were SERIOUS sexual acts that she should have never been exposed to as a little girl. As I was saying all this, my wife got more and more upset, and I could tell she was having a \"lightbulb\" moment and realizing the seriousness of the situation.\n\nMy wife (who was sobbing at this point) told me that she told her parents what happened to her when she was around sixteen. She wasn't upset with her brother, but was ashamed and thought she'd done something wrong. Her parents basically told her it was just normal childhood experimentation and she had nothing to be ashamed of. They also told her not to be upset with her brother because he was also a child at the time and didn't know right from wrong yet. My wife told me she was young, so she took their word for it and just kind of pushed the abuse to the back of her head. I was furious with my in-laws, and but tried to focus on comforting my wife + letting her know none of it was her fault.\n\nThe last few days have been a nightmare. My wife's family is supporting Tom and are convinced he was wrongly accused (they have an elaborate explanation for how the images got on his laptop that I won't get  into here). My wife is crying non-stop and is in so much pain. I feel terrible this happened to her, but the one thing I'm upset about is that she let our daughter near this man. If I'd known Tom did this to my wife, I would have never allowed my child in the same room as him. I told my wife that I wish I'd known for our baby's sake and added that while I'm devastated for her and love her so much, I'm still grappling with the fact that she allowed our little girl to be in the same room as a predator. My wife started SOBBING when I said this, and told me she didn't do it on purpose. She told me she accepted what her parents told her when she was a teenager and put it out of her mind. She said if she had thought about it more deeply as an adult, she probably would have realized Tom was a dangerous, but she truly never stopped to think about it again after her parents told her it was okay. We agree that neither of our kids will ever be around Tom again, but she said she couldn't believe I thought she'd intentionally put our child in harm's way. She also said she couldn't believe I was coming down on her after she's realizing she was a victim of child abuse and her family is falling apart.\n\nI love my wife and believe that she trusted her parents and put it in the back of her mind.... But I keep thinking about what might have happened if we'd continue to allow our daughter near that man. I believe my wife didn't consider this abuse until we talked and didn't consider that our daughter might be in danger, but I am still a bit puzzled by all of this. My wife is in so much pain, and I am not sure if I did the right thing by raising this issue while all of this is going on. AITA? And any advice would be appreciated... This all seems so over my head.",

(and NO I will not tell you my sister's name or anything about her murder). One time an American woman posted a video online where she talked about my sister's murder while putting on her makeup. She happily talked about my sister's death while she put on her makeup. It made me sick. My family has decided to have my sister exhumed and cremated. We are tried of people going to her grave and posing for pictures like you would do when you are on vacation and having a good time. We cannot even visit her grave in peace. It has been years and we get no peace. If these crime and murder hobby people see us they bother us. It's bad enough we get people coming to our homes or trying to make friends with us to get information about my sister. But seeing people post pictures of themselves posing at the grave was putting a strain on us. My family decided to have my sister cremated and keep the place we are scattering her ashes a secret. These people who like murder and crime for a hobby make me sick. (And no one don't care if anyone tries to tell me differently or say they have this hobby but are different). I have been sick over this. (If anyone asks for information about my sister I'll ignore it).",
