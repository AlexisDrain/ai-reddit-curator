I was terrified and hurt and confused and the comments really helped me sort through everything going on.\n\nA week later, I went into preterm labor and gave birth to my baby at 35 weeks.\n\nA week after that, my husband beat me unconscious when he caught me googling \"the signs of an abusive marriage\" after he coerced me into sex a week post-partum. \n\nToday I filed for divorce and secured a restraining order on him. My husband will never lay a hand on me or my baby ever again.\n\nI cannot confidently say that I would have made that decision without the help of my original post. So thank you so very much. I think maybe people do not realize how much you can help a stranger on the internet, but you can. And all of you did. I will be the woman who leaves after the first time. I will be the best mother I can be, and that starts with leaving him.\n\nThank you.\n\n",

He looked at me and said, \"Why do girls always order things that they know they can't finish?\" I said I was going to finish it and that I didn't appreciate his attitude. He then told me that I might think I can finish it, but I really can't. I told him I had eaten a whole burger before. He then said something along the lines of, \"A moment on the lips is a lifetime on the hips. I can tell you're letting yourself go.\" I got so pissed that I just took my burger and left.",

A student of mine started verbally assaulting him. I immediately had my son leave the classroom. I couldn\u2019t shut the door quick enough and my student ran out, jumped in my son, knocked him to the ground, began punching him on the head and face. When I tried to get him off, he head butted me, leaving me with a gushing bloody nose. It took 3 staff members to remove this child off my son. My son was bruised up and in pain, but no serious injuries. When I asked admin what was to be done with the student., I was told nothing. His BIP and IEP were not properly followed!!! It\u2019s my fault because I did not give proper notice to student that there would be a disruption in class (that\u2019s the abridged reason). I also got written up because I left my class to assist my son. I believe I will be giving my notice by the end of the week.",

    "selftext": "Ticketmaster is an unchecked monopoly. 100% of the concert going population is aware of this. The only way to stop it is for us to force change with our wallets. \n\nI became aware of this recently when it became nearly impossible for my wife to get tickets to any concerts she wanted to attend because of various lotteries and wait lists, which Ticketmaster has allowed to be overtaken by bots and scalpers. This situation caused a lot of understandable anger, and became a national news story with comments made by the president, but I figured lots of people want to see these popular artists, so of course it would become hard to get tickets. \n\nHowever, I recently saw that one of the absolute favorite foreign artists of my partner and mine was coming to my city on a tour. They are not super well known in the U.S., and they certainly don't tour often here, so I figured this was a perfect opportunity to go and see them. We went to purchase tickets. I make pretty good money, and there were plenty of ticket options available we could afford. We went to checkout, and upon reading the checkout page, realized that the \"fees\" would end up costing more than both tickets COMBINED. \n\nThis is simply absurd. I simply could not bring myself to make the purchase, as I could not support such a greedy and obviously corrupt business that has complete control of the live music industry with no competition and no checks and balances. And my partner and I made the decision that we will not, ever, go to another concert, or event in general, if it has tickets sold through Ticketmaster.\n\nBig artists who want to have any sort of tour that supports the size of their audience are FORCED to go through Ticketmaster. Venues who want to survive and have popular artists are FORCED to sign with only Ticketmaster after the merger. Fans are FORCED to buy from Ticketmaster if they want to see any of their favorite artists play. There is no choice anymore. \n\nThe only choice you can have if you want to see change happen is to boycott this service, until venues and artists (who are the only ones that can actually do anything about it) see an impact, and are forced to try to fight Ticketmaster. Or, until governments step in. \n\nIf you live near any large city, go find some local live music instead. It will be worth your while, much cheaper, and free of support for a corrupt monopoly, and I can guarantee you will find some gems. \n\nIf you have any awful Ticketmaster last straw stories, share them below, and let's try to bring more awareness to this issue so that more concert goers realize the importance of taking action, even if you can afford tickets. \n\nIn fact, don't just share them here. Share them on all your social media, bring awareness, and engage. \n\nHere is a petition you can sign:\nhttps://www.change.org/p/call-to-end-ticketmaster-monopoly?source_location=search",

    "title": "The craziest Labor Day in Yosemite",
    "selftext": "Yosemite, in dramatic fashion, changed my life.\n\nLabor Day Weekend 2017. 50,000 people in the valley, I\u2019ve got no wilderness pass and no reservations. Naively, with this being my first trip, I had no idea how busy the park would be and thought I could find a place to sleep. I did two loops around the valley and decided to leave the park taking Big Oak Flat Road towards San Fran.\n\nDriving by Camp White Wolf I decided to stop and see if there were any sites open for the night. As you\u2019d expect, there was nothing. Now, this is where it gets crazy; I\u2019m at the intersection of Big Oak Flat Road and I can go left and continue in the direction I was going or, I could go right and head back to the valley. Something possessed me to go right, knowing full well I was not going to find anything for me there.\n\nAbout 20 minutes from the valley a severe storm rolls in with high winds and rain. Just as I come around a corner I see a 110 foot tall pine tree fall and crush a car right in front of me. The tree fell down the long axis of the car completely crushing the passenger compartment. \n\nThe circumstances of what brought me to Yosemite are significant and are almost as dramatic as the events that took place that Labor Day.\n\nI am a Special Operations Independent Duty Corpsman a lay person would understand this as a Special Forces Medic. The 3 months preceding my trip to Yosemite was spent in a Shooting Package with Force Recon, in preparation for an upcoming deployment. \n\nDuring the training I had an explosive sympathetically detonate in my hand which did significant damage. I\u2019ll spare you the details but it was a freak accident where one planned detonation produced enough heat and overpressure to detonate the explosive in my hand. Pretty not fun.\n\nDespite the injury, I returned to training up to and immediately following surgery; a decision I regret. As you\u2019d expect, when the training package concluded I needed a break and really needed to heal, mentally and physically. I cannot overstate the state of disrepair I was in. The Friday before I left I was cleaning gear out of my jeep and as I held my med bag to return to my locker, I thought out loud and said \u201cI\u2019m going to Yosemite this weekend, I should probably keep it with me\u201d.\n\nWith my hand unhealed and the universe guiding me, I watched the tree fall.\n\nAs I got out of my jeep and slowly approached the vehicle the first observation I made was that the damage to the Prius was overwhelming. My immediate thought was that there was no way anyone was inside.\n\nMy heart sank when I realized a man and his daughter were outside the car screaming frantically. I realized someone was still in the car.\n\nI looked into the drivers side window and saw the man\u2019s wife unconscious and unresponsive, leaning into the center console. I shifted my eyes to the back and my vision narrowed; a small boy (later determined to be 4 years old) was crushed into his booster seat. He was bent forward at the waist, his right temple was on the outside of his left knee. \n\nI entered the vehicle through the rear driver side window. I immediately assessed the mother, manually adjusted her airway and gave her a rescue breath, she started breathing. I directed bystanders to be careful of her head and neck and get her out of the car.\n\nI was now focused on the little boy. I had to squat the roof off his back in order to move him safely and not do further damage. His lifeless body melted into my arms. (have since had a baby boy. This part of the story makes me particularly emotional).\n\nI immediately assess his radial and carotid pulse; very strong. This boy is fighting for his life. Despite a solid pulse he is not breathing. I tried to open his airway and squeeze in a rescue breath but no response. His jaw was locked.\n\nAs I\u2019m making these efforts, the roof is slowly being crushed further by the weight of the tree.\n\nI hand the boy out the window and exit myself and immediately take him back. I am now 100% focused on getting his airway open. I gradually increased my application of strength to get his jaw open, to the point that i thought his jaw was going to break. Finally! It opens, it is completely occluded with blood and vomit. I removed the obstructions and and send another rescue breath.\n\nHe arches his back and lets out a crying scream like a newborn baby. The relieve I felt brought tears to my eyes then and does now.\n\nI spoke to dispatch after I heard a bystander call them and say \u201ci think the little boy is dead\u201d. I said \u201cgive me the phone\u201d. I relayed patient disposition and stated \u201cI do not recommend ground transport. They need to be flown out of here\u201d. \n\nThe only questioned they asked was  \u201cwho are you?\u201d.\n\nAs I was assessing the mother, who was breathing but unresponsive, I thought to myself \u201cman, I\u2019d kill for a BVM and a cervical collar\u201d\u2026 and then I remember I had my freakin med bag!\n\nI was managing care and using a Spanish speaking bystander to translate what I was doing to the father and daughter. Heartbreakingly, they were on vacation in Yosemite visiting from Mexico. \n\n12-15 mins later paramedics arrived. I left in the ambulance with the little boy and continued assisting in treatments.\n\nWithin mins of us arriving at the Helo Landing Zone, a Life Flight Helicopter was arriving from Modesto Children\u2019s Hospital. Dispatch had listened to me. They requested a helicopter immediately.\n\nMuch happened after that event. I went on to get a camp site in Upper Pines.

    "title": "AITAH for \"glowing up\" after my divorce and not before?",
    "selftext": "I (53F) have been divorced from my ex-husband \"Larry\" (54M) for 6 years. Larry and I have two adult children, \"Steve\" (27M) and \"Carla\" (25F).\n\nLarry and I met in college when we were both electrical engineering students. We were both very much on the nerdy side and looked the part, but were very attracted to each other (so I thought anyway). We got married soon after we graduated and both worked as engineers, but after a few years Larry decided he wanted to go to law school (to become a patent lawyer). In order to look the lawyer part, Larry underwent a major glow-up during this time on pretty much all levels (tailored clothes, fancy haircuts, designer accessories like watches, etc., along with working out to trade his \"dad bod\" for a lean gym bod). During this time, I was having/raising our small children, while taking care of about 95% of household matters because of his long working hours, all while working full time. \n\nI admit I did not \"glow up\" along with Larry. My own appearance has always been on the plainer side - I'm not overweight but a bit stocky (5'5\"/140 lbs), simply cut hair, glasses, practical clothes, not much makeup. Larry loved me as-is for about the first decade of our relationship, but after he started working as a lawyer, he started to become drawn to more conventionally attractive women and had several affairs. When I pressed for counseling, he said that the issues were things like my big nose and post-baby tummy pooch (not things I could fix with a simple makeover). I was getting organized to ask for a divorce when Carla was hit by a car while riding her bike. She survived and is fine now, but needed several years of intensive surgeries and rehab. In order to provide a unified front for Carla (and Steve), Larry and I agreed to stay married and be as cordial as possible (he continued to see other women during this time, but by this time I was past trying to get him to be faithful). We did separate (and divorce) after Carla went off to college. Larry is remarried now to a much younger woman (33F). \n\nIn the past couple years, I have actually decided to focus more on myself - including my appearance. Now that my children are grown and out of the house, and I don't have to worry about tiptoeing around a difficult husband, I finally have time and resources to do so. I didn't get a nose job or other plastic surgery like Larry had wanted, but I did update and color my hair, started working out more (lost about 15 pounds), got a new wardrobe, and actually started dating (I don't have a steady partner yet, but regularly go to age-appropriate singles events and go on dates). Unfortunately, my children detest the \"new me.\" In particular, they blame me for the divorce and are angry that I didn't \"glow up\" to accommodate Larry, saying I was too selfish and lazy to do so \"when it mattered.\" My son Steve is getting married soon, and says he is too angry to invite me to the wedding. Carla has gone low-contact with me. I had great relationships with both of them until I started my own glow-up process a couple years ago, which was a few years after Larry and I finalized our divorce. Steve and Carla have told me that the only way to fix this - the only thing that would be fair - is to go back to the way I was before - meaning stop coloring my hair, dress in my former plain/frumpy way, and stop dating. They say they are most upset about the dating and that it's not fair for me to be looking for a new partner.\n\nSo, AITAH for everything I have done here - for not improving my appearance until after I got divorced? I really don't think Larry would have been faithful to me no matter how much I twisted myself in knots. I felt I did the best I could given the energy and resources I had, and, while it may seem selfish, I do believe I deserve to have my own life now? But I am open to other opinions if I have done something wrong here.",

I wore a silicone one for a few months but when that snapped, I just stopped wearing my ring altogether.\n\nMy older relatives are perplexed.

    "selftext": "In 2017, I was newly divorced, raising 2 boys, and working (more than) full time as a chef. I made the decision to go back to school and work toward a degree in Marriage and Family Therapy. \nIt has been a transformative journey, one of un-learning, self-empowerment, and leaning into the support of my community. Nothing about this has been easy- I struggled with anxiety, depression, imposter\u2019s syndrome, and undiagnosed neurodivergence on top of the typical struggles of single parenthood (navigating programs like Medicaid and Food Stamps).\n\nIn my internship, I worked with children and families on Medicaid at a community behavioral health clinic. My lived experience as a recipient of government assistance underscores how little consideration is given to the strategically undervalued families who struggle to make ends meet because of marital status and a lack of access to resources for genderqueer and high needs children, (undiagnosed neurodivergence, C-PTSD, learning differences, sensory differences, etc) and overwhelmed parents. \n\nI plan to continue working with vulnerable communities and put my energy toward helping those who need it most. Still, I am in a vulnerable position as a single mom. Choosing to work in community mental health means that I make less now as a therapist than I did 7 years ago as a chef. I know altruism doesn\u2019t pay the bills, and my $90,000 in student loan debt will take the rest of my life to pay off, but I\u2019m happier and feel more purposeful and driven than ever. \nI did not pursue counseling as a career to be financially wealthy, I did it to feel wealthy in spirit and to be of service to my fellow humans. \n\nI am so fucking proud of myself and know that I can do ANYTHING!

    "selftext": "So, I recently moved into a new neighbourhood, and I\u2019ve been trying to be that friendly, helpful neighbour. You know, the one who offers to bring in the post or roll the bins back up the driveway. Well, yesterday, I decided to do just that for my neighbour, Sarah, who had left her bins out even though it wasn\u2019t bin day.\n\nBeing the eager new guy, I thought it would be a nice gesture to bring the bins back up to her house. So, I walk over, grab the bins, and start rolling them up her driveway. When I get closer, I notice her front door is slightly open. Thinking I should let her know, I called out, \u201cHey, Sarah! Your door\u2019s open!\u201d No response.\n\nSo, like the nosy idiot I am, I took a few steps closer to see if everything was alright. And that\u2019s when I saw her\u2014Sarah, walking down her hallway, completely naked, clearly having just stepped out of the shower.\n\nWe locked eyes, and both of us froze. I\u2019m standing there like an idiot, holding her bin, while she\u2019s standing there like\u2026 well, not exactly how you\u2019d want your new neighbour to see you. Instead of just walking away, I panicked and blurted out, \u201cSorry! I was just helping with the bins!\u201d\n\nShe screamed, I panicked even more, and in my desperation to escape the situation, I managed to trip over her bin, sending it\u2014and myself\u2014sprawling across her driveway. It was like watching a car crash in slow motion, except the car was me, and I was crashing into my own dignity.\n\nSomehow, I managed to scramble to my feet and do the fastest speed walk back to my house ever recorded. I didn\u2019t dare look back, but I\u2019m pretty sure I heard her door slam behind me. \n\nI spent the rest of the day avoiding my windows like the plague, too embarrassed to even peek outside in case I accidentally made eye contact with her again. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be offering to help with the bins anymore\u2026\n\nTL;DR: Tried to be a friendly new neighbour by bringing in my neighbour\u2019s bins, accidentally saw her naked through her open door, then speed-walked back home after tripping over her bin in my panic. Safe to say, I\u2019ll be laying low for a while.",
