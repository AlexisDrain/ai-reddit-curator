My husband will never lay a hand on me or my baby ever again.\n\nI cannot confidently say that I would have made that decision without the help of my original post. So thank you so very much.

    "title": "The craziest Labor Day in Yosemite",
    "selftext": "Yosemite, in dramatic fashion, changed my life.\n\nLabor Day Weekend 2017. 50,000 people in the valley, I\u2019ve got no wilderness pass and no reservations. Naively, with this being my first trip, I had no idea how busy the park would be and thought I could find a place to sleep. I did two loops around the valley and decided to leave the park taking Big Oak Flat Road towards San Fran.\n\nDriving by Camp White Wolf I decided to stop and see if there were any sites open for the night. As you\u2019d expect, there was nothing. Now, this is where it gets crazy; I\u2019m at the intersection of Big Oak Flat Road and I can go left and continue in the direction I was going or, I could go right and head back to the valley. Something possessed me to go right, knowing full well I was not going to find anything for me there.\n\nAbout 20 minutes from the valley a severe storm rolls in with high winds and rain. Just as I come around a corner I see a 110 foot tall pine tree fall and crush a car right in front of me. The tree fell down the long axis of the car completely crushing the passenger compartment. \n\nThe circumstances of what brought me to Yosemite are significant and are almost as dramatic as the events that took place that Labor Day.\n\nI am a Special Operations Independent Duty Corpsman a lay person would understand this as a Special Forces Medic. The 3 months preceding my trip to Yosemite was spent in a Shooting Package with Force Recon, in preparation for an upcoming deployment. \n\nDuring the training I had an explosive sympathetically detonate in my hand which did significant damage. I\u2019ll spare you the details but it was a freak accident where one planned detonation produced enough heat and overpressure to detonate the explosive in my hand. Pretty not fun.\n\nDespite the injury, I returned to training up to and immediately following surgery; a decision I regret. As you\u2019d expect, when the training package concluded I needed a break and really needed to heal, mentally and physically. I cannot overstate the state of disrepair I was in. The Friday before I left I was cleaning gear out of my jeep and as I held my med bag to return to my locker, I thought out loud and said \u201cI\u2019m going to Yosemite this weekend, I should probably keep it with me\u201d.\n\nWith my hand unhealed and the universe guiding me, I watched the tree fall.\n\nAs I got out of my jeep and slowly approached the vehicle the first observation I made was that the damage to the Prius was overwhelming. My immediate thought was that there was no way anyone was inside.\n\nMy heart sank when I realized a man and his daughter were outside the car screaming frantically. I realized someone was still in the car.\n\nI looked into the drivers side window and saw the man\u2019s wife unconscious and unresponsive, leaning into the center console. I shifted my eyes to the back and my vision narrowed; a small boy (later determined to be 4 years old) was crushed into his booster seat. He was bent forward at the waist, his right temple was on the outside of his left knee. \n\nI entered the vehicle through the rear driver side window. I immediately assessed the mother, manually adjusted her airway and gave her a rescue breath, she started breathing. I directed bystanders to be careful of her head and neck and get her out of the car.\n\nI was now focused on the little boy. I had to squat the roof off his back in order to move him safely and not do further damage. His lifeless body melted into my arms. (have since had a baby boy. This part of the story makes me particularly emotional).\n\nI immediately assess his radial and carotid pulse; very strong. This boy is fighting for his life. Despite a solid pulse he is not breathing. I tried to open his airway and squeeze in a rescue breath but no response. His jaw was locked.\n\nAs I\u2019m making these efforts, the roof is slowly being crushed further by the weight of the tree.\n\nI hand the boy out the window and exit myself and immediately take him back. I am now 100% focused on getting his airway open. I gradually increased my application of strength to get his jaw open, to the point that i thought his jaw was going to break. Finally! It opens, it is completely occluded with blood and vomit. I removed the obstructions and and send another rescue breath.\n\nHe arches his back and lets out a crying scream like a newborn baby. The relieve I felt brought tears to my eyes then and does now.\n\nI spoke to dispatch after I heard a bystander call them and say \u201ci think the little boy is dead\u201d. I said \u201cgive me the phone\u201d. I relayed patient disposition and stated \u201cI do not recommend ground transport. They need to be flown out of here\u201d. \n\nThe only questioned they asked was  \u201cwho are you?\u201d.\n\nAs I was assessing the mother, who was breathing but unresponsive, I thought to myself \u201cman, I\u2019d kill for a BVM and a cervical collar\u201d\u2026 and then I remember I had my freakin med bag!\n\nI was managing care and using a Spanish speaking bystander to translate what I was doing to the father and daughter. Heartbreakingly, they were on vacation in Yosemite visiting from Mexico. \n\n12-15 mins later paramedics arrived. I left in the ambulance with the little boy and continued assisting in treatments.\n\nWithin mins of us arriving at the Helo Landing Zone, a Life Flight Helicopter was arriving from Modesto Children\u2019s Hospital. Dispatch had listened to me. They requested a helicopter immediately.\n\nMuch happened after that event. I went on to get a camp site in Upper Pines. I spent that night and the following 5 in the wilderness reflecting on the events that day. My hand still had stitches in it. \n\nI\u2019ve attached a few pics, hopefully they upload.",

    "selftext": "Ticketmaster is an unchecked monopoly. 100% of the concert going population is aware of this. The only way to stop it is for us to force change with our wallets. \n\nI became aware of this recently when it became nearly impossible for my wife to get tickets to any concerts she wanted to attend because of various lotteries and wait lists, which Ticketmaster has allowed to be overtaken by bots and scalpers. This situation caused a lot of understandable anger, and became a national news story with comments made by the president, but I figured lots of people want to see these popular artists, so of course it would become hard to get tickets. \n\nHowever, I recently saw that one of the absolute favorite foreign artists of my partner and mine was coming to my city on a tour. They are not super well known in the U.S., and they certainly don't tour often here, so I figured this was a perfect opportunity to go and see them. We went to purchase tickets. I make pretty good money, and there were plenty of ticket options available we could afford. We went to checkout, and upon reading the checkout page, realized that the \"fees\" would end up costing more than both tickets COMBINED. \n\nThis is simply absurd. I simply could not bring myself to make the purchase, as I could not support such a greedy and obviously corrupt business that has complete control of the live music industry with no competition and no checks and balances. And my partner and I made the decision that we will not, ever, go to another concert, or event in general, if it has tickets sold through Ticketmaster.\n\nBig artists who want to have any sort of tour that supports the size of their audience are FORCED to go through Ticketmaster. Venues who want to survive and have popular artists are FORCED to sign with only Ticketmaster after the merger. Fans are FORCED to buy from Ticketmaster if they want to see any of their favorite artists play. There is no choice anymore. \n\nThe only choice you can have if you want to see change happen is to boycott this service, until venues and artists (who are the only ones that can actually do anything about it) see an impact, and are forced to try to fight Ticketmaster. Or, until governments step in. \n\nIf you live near any large city, go find some local live music instead. It will be worth your while, much cheaper, and free of support for a corrupt monopoly, and I can guarantee you will find some gems. \n\nIf you have any awful Ticketmaster last straw stories, share them below, and let's try to bring more awareness to this issue so that more concert goers realize the importance of taking action, even if you can afford tickets. \n\nIn fact, don't just share them here. Share them on all your social media, bring awareness, and engage. \n\nHere is a petition you can sign:\nhttps://www.change.org/p/call-to-end-ticketmaster-monopoly?source_location=search",

Today's euro -&gt; USD conversion ratio is 1.1087. I programmed a tool that assists me in fetching this data and updating the post. If you'd like to check current prices directly, you can check [Lang &amp; Schwarz](https://www.ls-tc.de/de/aktie/gamestop-aktie) or [TradeGate](https://www.tradegate.de/orderbuch.php?isin=US36467W1099)\n\nDiamantenh\u00e4nde isn't simply a thread on Superstonk, it's a community that gathers daily to represent the many corners of this world who love this stock. Many thanks to the originator of the series, DerGurkenraspler, who we wish well. We all love seeing the energy that people represent their varied homelands.

    "selftext": "AITAH for getting hurt and upset over a \u201charmless prank\u201d that my husband pulled?\n\nOOP is u/Far_Specific_3005 and this was posted on r/AITAH.\n\n\n#ORIGINAL (1 month ago): \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1efec9q/aitah_for_getting_hurt_and_upset_over_a_harmless/\n\n\nSo me and my husband have been married for five years. We are currently f24 and m33. Way before we met, when I was 16, my mom\u2019s house had a house fire that burnt literally everything down and sadly my childhood cat was also killed in it.\n\nI remember my mom and brother waking me up screaming \u201cfire, fire, get up, get up!\u201d We crawled out under the smoke and luckily my neighbors had already called the fire department and they pulled us out. We lost literally everything. We were devastated.\nSo that was a while ago but it still really scares me, and I check outlets and our stove and candles and everything all the time. My husband knows this about me.\n\nSo two nights ago I went to bed early because I am currently 34 weeks pregnant, literally about to pop. I was sleeping for a while before for some reason, my husband decided to wake me up by yelling \u201cbaby! There\u2019s a fire! Fire, fire, fire! Get up!\u201d\n\nAs quick as I could get up at 34 weeks, I did, and grabbed my purse. I was just in automatic shock and just autopilot and knew I needed what to grab. I made it all the way down the stairs, yelling for my husband to follow me, before he started laughing and telling me it was a joke.\n\nIt took a minute for that to process. I stood there with an open mouth while he laughed and ushered me down the rest of the stairs. I sat down on the couch and just started sobbing. It was genuinely the hardest I\u2019ve ever sobbed, it\u2019s like I couldn\u2019t get myself to stop and my whole body was shaking. My heart was racing and I couldn\u2019t breathe. I have never had this experience before, I was genuinely so panicked.\n\nI was so fucking upset. My husband apologized and was like \u201coh my god, I\u2019m sorry, it was just a joke\u201d. I just cried until he eventually was like \u201cwhat the fuck it was just a prank, this is really dramatic.\u201d\n\nAfter a few hours, I had calmed myself down and went to apologize to him. He wouldn\u2019t take it. He said I was being over dramatic and made him feel like shit for a harmless prank. So I guess AITAH? I\u2019ve never been good at taking jokes, I\u2019ve been trying to be less sensitive but idk.\n\n##Additional Info from OOP in the Comments\n\n\n_On why she apologized:_\nI apologized because he mad a big deal about me making him feel horrible\n\n_On how often her husbands plays pranks on her and makes jokes at her expense:_\nHe doesn\u2019t but it\u2019s an often argument that I am \u201ctoo sensitive\u201d. \n\n_On comments that the fire happened when OOP and her husband were already dating (her at 16 and husband at 24):_\nThis is not true. We met when I was 18. \n\n_When asked if husband is happy about the baby, if he is a narcissist, and if there are other red flags in the relationship:_\nHe\u2019s happy, he\u2019s the one who wanted a baby. I don\u2019t think he is a narcissist though I\u2019m not sure the definition of that lol. And no I don\u2019t think there are red flags other what is being pointed out in the comments I am reading. That is mostly that he tries to make me feel sensitive and our ages but I always knew that and I never cared. \n\n\n##Comments\n\n\n**u/Betheroo5:**\nNo, you\u2019re absolutely NTAH. That wasn\u2019t a \u201charmless prank\u201d when he knows your past trauma. It also wouldn\u2019t have been a \u201charmless prank\u201d even without that trauma because you are pregnant. The adrenaline spike from something like that could have easily sent you into preterm labor and while I\u2019m sure you feel ready to pop, you\u2019re not yet full term and the baby\u2019s lungs are the last to develop. He\u2019s definitely the AH, but more than that - that was psychological abuse. It was not a prank, it was not funny, and it very well could have done physical harm as well. And now he\u2019s trying to gaslight you into thinking that you\u2019re the problem. Please be very careful and keep yourself safe.\n\n**u/pricklypear_tortilla:**\nWhen I read what he did my first thought was \u201cThis is NOT a harmless prank\u201d. I know babies can survive outside of the womb at 34 weeks, but the risk of complications is so high at this stage still. He literally put his wife and child\u2019s lives at risk for a joke that isn\u2019t even funny\n\n**u/ohyoureTHATjocelyn:**\nIt was never meant to be funny. It was intended to harm, with just enough plausible deniability to be able to convince HER that he was just joking and that he deserves the apology rather than her.\n\n**u/CutLow8166:**\nAnd maybe the most important\n\nWTF is wrong with him for pulling a prank on you WHILE YOU ARE PREGNANT, and not just pregnant, but \u201cliterally about to pop\u201d pregnant?! You\u2019re not suppose to go through like any stress right now, not even the stress from an actually harmless prank. He is fucking lucky his bullshit didn\u2019t cause harm to the baby or push you into early labor or something. This was a super dangerous and mean thing to do. You don\u2019t need to apologize. He does.\n\n**OOP replies:**\nI didn\u2019t even think about this, I am 34 weeks but I still need at least 2 more to make sure the baby is fully grown and healthy. That could\u2019ve been horrible. \n\n\n\n#UPDATE (Today):\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1f6v5i0/update_aitah_for_getting_hurt_and_upset_over_a/\n\n\nA month ago I posted my first post, which is still up on my account. I was terrified and hurt and confused and the comments really helped me sort through everything going on.\n\nA week later, I went into preterm labor and gave birth to my baby at 35 weeks.\n\nA week after that, my husband beat me unconscious when he caught me googling \"the signs of an abusive marriage\" after he coerced me into sex a week post-partum.\n\nToday I filed for divorce and secured a restraining order on him. My husband will never lay a hand on me or my baby ever again.\n\nI cannot confidently say that I would have made that decision without the help of my original post. So thank you so very much. I think maybe people do not realize how much you can help a stranger on the internet, but you can. And all of you did. I will be the woman who leaves after the first time. I will be the best mother I can be, and that starts with leaving him.\n\nThank you.\n\n",

I thought to myself \u201cgod fucking damn it now I gotta wait until this guy leaves\u201d. 5 minutes went by and we\u2019re both silent. We did not make one noise and I thought to myself \u201cfuck this I can\u2019t take this anymore, I gotta do something.\u201d So right before I violently ripped, I said out loud, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry in advance\u201d and absolutely shitted after. Now what REALLY caught me off guard was after that, the guy giggled and said \u201chey man no worries I\u2019m sorry too\u201d and shat even louder than me. After that I made small talk with him while he was still in the stall and I was out washing my hands. After that we said farewell and went on with our lives. I really think we bonded over a poop session.",
