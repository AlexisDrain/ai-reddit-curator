    "selftext": "I want to say that my husband has never ever behaved like this before. This is the first he\u2019s ever scared me and I have no idea what to do.\u00a0\n\nI am 23 weeks pregnant with our first baby and we have been married for three years. I am f24 and he is m32.\u00a0\n\nMy husband owns firearms and works in law enforcement and is trained to handle them safely. They stay in a locked safe at home and he has never once played around with them. All of that is for context.\u00a0\n\nSo as for what happened yesterday, I was simply walking through the kitchen as I noticed my husband at the kitchen counter looking at one of the firearms. I didn\u2019t say anything but I looked over at him, wondering what he was doing. He had gotten home from work and right before this we talked for a bit, we had dinner, and I took a shower. Everything was good and normal.\u00a0\n\nAs I looked at him, my husband looked up at me and stared for a second, blinked, and then picked the gun up and pointed it at my tummy, with a completely straight face.\n\nMy heart fucking dropped of course and I smacked the gun down. My husband then started laughing. But the split second of pure seriousness on his face was terrifying. I asked him why the fuck he did that and he says \u201cdo you think it scared him?\u201d Talking about, I assume, the baby.\u00a0\n\nI didn\u2019t know what to say but tears welled up in my eyes. This prompted a half an hour long apology and hours of \u201ccomfort\u201d from him, with claims that he \u201cwasn\u2019t thinking\u201d but also \u201cjust joking\u201d.\u00a0\n\nThe look in his eyes scared me. The fact that he pointed the gun at me is terrifying. Idk what to do. I\u2019m so upset. I\u2019m so distraught. Am I overreacting?",

Suddenly Saturn's body is getting older then explodes, leaving only his skeleton. \n\n- At the floating Punk Record, we can see new Vegapunk consisting of Edison, Shaka, Pythagoras, and Atlas. They have four minds inside one body. \n\n- Cut to Kamabakka Kingdom, Koala summarized Vegapunk's message. Dragon says they need to end this as soon as possible. The war to secure safe place on the planet is about to happen. \n\nEnd of the chapter.",

    "selftext": "Repost with proof\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/9cSiGz4\n\nBefore Venus and Serena were born, he had a successful cleaning company, concrete company, and a security guard company.  He owned three houses.  He had 810,000 in the bank just for their tennis.  Adjusted for inflation, he was a multi-millionaire.  \n\nKing Richard led me to believe he was a poor security guard barely making ends meet but through his own power and the girl's unique talent, they caught the attention of sponsors that paid for the rest of their training.  Fact was they lived in a house in Long Beach minutes away from the beach.  He moved them to Compton because he had read about Malcolm X and Muhammad Ali coming from the ghetto so they would become battle-hardened and not feel pressure from their matches.  For a father to willingly move his young family to the ghetto is already a fascinating story.  But instead we got lies through omission.  \n\nHow many families fell for this false narrative (that's also been put forth by the media?  As a tennis fan for decades I also fell for it) and fell into financial ruin because they dedicated their limited resources and eventually couldn't pay enough for their kids' tennis lessons to get them to having even enough skills to make it to a D3 college?  Kids who lost countless afternoons of their childhoods because of this false narrative?  Or who got a sponsorship with unfair terms and crumbled under the pressure of having to support their families?  Or who got on the lower level tours and didn't have the money to stay on long enough even though they were winning because the prize money is peanuts?  Parents whose marriages disintegrated under such stress?  And who then blamed themselves?  Because just hard work wasn't enough.  Not nearly. They needed money.  Shame on King Richard and biopics like it.",

    "selftext": "Long before the god Maglubiyet conquered them, early goblins served in the court of the Queen of Air and Darkness, one of the Feywild\u2019s archfey. Goblins thrived in her dangerous domain thanks to a special boon from her\u2014a supernatural knack for finding the weak spots in foes larger than themselves and for getting out of trouble. Goblins brought this fey boon with them to worlds across the Material Plane, even if they don\u2019t remember the fey realm they inhabited before Maglubiyet\u2019s rise. Now many goblins pursue their own destinies, escaping the plots of both archfey and gods.\u201d\n\nNow the part about larger enemy weak spots, that got me thinking about the intro to moonrise towers where the three goblins are on trial for failing their mission if Minthara was killed by Tav. The female goblin with the short blond hair attacks Ketheric. Both times she hits his armor weak spots. First in the upper stomach, lower chest area where the black fabric is. Then, at his unprotected neck. She had the knack for it. If she didn\u2019t have that boon and with a low intelligence score maybe she\u2019d just bounce a blow off his heavy armor. ",

    "title": "UPDATE - tradies stealing electricity",
    "selftext": "  \nHi all. Regarding my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/brisbane/comments/1f4fv6t/tradies_on_property/) the other day, quite a few people have reached out asking for an update, so I figured I would give one publicly. First up though just want to say thanks for the advice and support!\n\nI was very fed up of them trespassing and stealing my power, so I locked a gate which encloses the undercover area, preventing them from coming in to unplug their cords, essentially preserving the evidence. I then called police link and reported the issue (I told them that it wasn\u2019t an emergency but it was a situation happening right now). The operator was really nice and said he would put a report in and get a crew out to my house as soon as possible. Not even 15 mins later (I live near the station), some police in a van arrived at the site next door and spoke to the tradies. They came to my back gate where I met them with the keys, and I showed them the \u201cscene of the crime\u201d so to speak. On their recommendation, the tradies and their company were issued with an official warning (details taken etc). I told them that if it happened again I would request that charges be pressed. The site was then deserted for the remainder of the day.\n\nI separately rang the building company\u2019s director, as I had a feeling that their site supervisor was going to try and hide what had happened. My prediction was correct. He was pretty pissed off, but he did try at length to defend what they did. I shut that down by repeating that I would be asking for charges to be pressed if it happened again. He then asked if I would be open to negotiating an arrangement where they could keep using the power. I said that had that been proposed before the stealing commenced, I would have considered it, but I no longer had any trust in them and so the answer was a hard no.\n\nFast forward a couple of days and they\u2019re using a portable generator on site. A miracle. Wonder why they couldn\u2019t have done that in the first place!\n\nOverall, I just hope I don't have to deal with any more drama.",

    "selftext": "My HOA, in Texas, has recently FLIPPED OUT, because we painted our house black. The photo attached isn\u2019t the actual house but it could be. Originally, all of the houses built, in the early 2000\u2019s, were similar pastel colors. Light grey, yellow, blue, etc.. very boring. The CCRs state that to repaint your house you have to submit the color to the architectural control committee (ACC) and that the colors be \u201charmonious\u201d with the neighborhood or some BS like that. Nothing specifically prohibits any specific color. We followed the rules to the letter, got written approval from the ACC but now the HOA president, Karen, is trying to make us repaint and force the members of the ACC to retract the approval or resign. I say they can kick rocks. What I don\u2019t get is WHY DOES SHE CARE?? It doesn\u2019t impact her in any way and the neighborhood, although outside of this particular HOA, already has tons of black houses. Do they seriously think that forcing every house to look the same will somehow boost property values? I think the opposite. (It\u2019s also worth noting that every house in the HOA has tripled in value over the last 10 years so home value is not even an argument by any stretch). ",
