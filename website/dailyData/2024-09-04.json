We got into a fight about it and I told her she has no right to slut shame my daughter and doesn't get a say in what she should wear and she was sulking for a day because of that.\n\nThen the next day, the dress was gone. She got rid of it so my daughter wouldn't wear it. My daughter didn't say anything but next day we found the wedding dress, torn in pieces and completely unfixable.\nMy daughter shrugged and said it was slutty so she got rid of it. My fiancee was crying for a day because she had spent a long time looking for that dress and loved it.\n\nNow fiancee wants a \"childfree\" wedding which is another way of saying she wants to uninvite my daughter. I told her she can have a childfree wedding, with someone else, because the wedding is off if my daughter isn't in it. Now she thinks I'm an asshole.",

At this point I decided to become the President to dissolve this shithole and enjoy my chickens in peace. \n\nWell we did it.....it took 6 months and a lot of headaches but its done. I defunded this fucker, sold off the poolhouse, and can now listen to my rooster crow each morning (hes a quiet boy) knowing that the world has one less HOA and sip my coffee in peace. ",

    "selftext": "I have wanted a black kitty for as long as i can remember and I was so excited to bring home this boy. I\u2019ve owned a few cats, always strays that \u201cchose\u201d me, and this is my first time as an adult owning my own cat as well as my first time adopting. He was described by previous owner who was rehoming him as super friendly, cuddly, etc., which made me even more excited as I have met some friendly cats recently (mine growing up weren\u2019t really cuddly) and really was hoping to experience that myself.\n\nTo sum up what has happened since picking him up yesterday morning: he cried and open-mouth panted (pictured) the whole ride home, he hid in the bathroom (where I put him to get comfortable) all day and didn\u2019t touch either wet or dry food (or water), last night when he escaped the bathroom and hid in my closet he hissed, spit at, and scratched me when I tried to put him back. Now he\u2019s hiding again (this time under the couch) and still hasn\u2019t eaten. \n\nI\u2019m worried for him. Is not eating/drinking for 24-48 hours normal for a cat? I\u2019ve never had a cat respond with this much intense fear, let alone a cat described as he was (friendly, cuddly, etc.) I\u2019m also worried that these aren\u2019t signs of a friendly cat. I do have a dog and I can\u2019t keep a cat around who would attack her.\n\nWhat should I do? Do I stick it out? How much time does he need? Does anyone have experience with a friendly cat turning almost feral under stressful conditions?\n\nI\u2019d really love any suggestions and support. Seeing him like this is breaking my heart. Thanks\ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udc08\u200d\u2b1b",

    "selftext": "I know I\u2019m NTA on this one now but at the time I honestly kind of felt I was at fault. Anyway, (at the time) I, 22 F upset my husband, 24 M because I cried at his \u201cprank\u201d. My ex husband always loved playing pranks on me. Some of them were annoying but in general I maintained a good attitude about them. Then one night he woke me up around 3 AM and he just kept laughing while staring at me. After repeatedly asking him why he was laughing, he finally told me to go look in the mirror.\n\nOne of my eyebrows was completely gone. I was devastated and I cried my eyes out. He got angry with me, claiming that it was just a joke and it wasn\u2019t that big of a deal. He said I had ruined the prank because my crying took all the fun out of it.  I had to shave the other brow because I looked so weird with only one. Sadly, I had never even drawn my eyebrows on before in my life. I learned the best I could but it\u2019s honestly really hard to do without having an eyebrow to go off of. Looking back, I can\u2019t believe I let him make me feel guilty. It took almost an entire year for my eyebrows to grow back.\n\n\n\nEdited because so many people are asking in the comments and I cannot possibly keep up. I am very much split up from this person. It took almost ten years of narcissistic abuse to open my eyes but I\u2019m now living my best life and I only have contact with him in regards to our son. I\u2019ll do my best to comment back to everyone who took the time to read the post but I\u2019m a mom with a full time job so bear with me. ",

    "title": "Weevil, NOT FRANKIE, is the abandoned son of Queen that Oda hinted at. ",
    "selftext": "Oda threw out Frankie's name to get people look into the details he handed out for a certain someone(Weevil) being Queen's son. Classic misdirection. This is truly a matter of reading comprehension. Details:\n\n- They look virtually identical besides the obviously out of place beard Weevil has. Same exact build, same exact hair color, same exact facial structure, braided hairstyle matches exactly, SAME EXACT NOSE, SAME EXACT NO-BROW LOOK, SAME NEARLY EVERYTHING.\n\n\u2022 around the same height (Queen is 20ft or so while weevil is 22ft)\n\u2022 Son of Stussy, so he's guaranteed to have been experimented on as evident by his many patchwork scars (His left arm seems to have been severed and is significantly skinnier than his right arm)\n\u2022 The name \"Weevil\" itself may imply that he has been \u201cwoven\" together, as in DNA splicing, something that's right up Queen &amp; Stussy's ally. \nThey both are from the same Mad Scientist group\n\n- [Etymology: \" From Middle English wevel, from Old English wifel (\"beetle\"), from Proto-Germanic *wibilaz, from Proto-Indo-European *webhel-, from *(h:) webh-(\"to wave, to weave\"), said to be from the woven appearance of a weevil's larval case, 11] + *-el-, *-I-(diminutive or attributive suffix); see also wave and weave.\"]\n\nMost likely Stussy regretted having a kid with Queen &amp; wanted to pass off her failure as the son of the World's Strongest Man, Whitebeard. Whitebeard, the man who constantly emphasizes the importance of family, would never abandon his biological son. Perhaps he knew Weevil wasn't truly his truly his kid.\n\nAgain, this was classic misdirection by Oda and a majority of fans fell for thanks to the help of the Big News Morgan\u2019s we have running around (the sensationalist One Piece tweeters with thousands of follows who spread misinformation at the drop of a hat for interaction revenue + Redditors regurgitating that same misinformation.)\n\nWeevil is the son of Queen, NOT Frankie.

The price it shows on the app is not the same as you end up paying.  I wanted to reach my destination asap so I booked \u2018book any\u2019 the cost was from 261 to 350 but in the app after booking the premium it is now showing 559 \u20b9 \n\n2. The driver did not turn on the AC. The driver said his AC is not working. If the AC is not working why are you calling it a premium cab? Why would you charge the premium fare and send a shitty car? \n\n3. You cannot raise a complaint about the payment or talk to the customer service directly at all on their app this is by design. \n\n4. The thing that bothers me the most is the time taken for the cab to come to my pickup point. I know how bad Ola is and how much I hate it but the only reason I booked Ola is because it said I will get the car in 4 minutes but it was showing 16 mins on Uber and 10 minutes on Namma Yatri. But the car came 20 mins late. \n\nI probably hate Ola more than all the auto drivers of bangalore. It is not surprising that the CEO Bhavish Aggrawal is probably the biggest scammer and liar. I cannot wait for Ola and him to fail miserably in future. ",
