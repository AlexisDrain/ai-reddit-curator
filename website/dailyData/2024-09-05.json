    "selftext": "Back story:\n\nMy (42m) ex-wife (44f) and I were married for almost 20 years. Over that time she had 4 affairs of varying degrees including a sexual relationship with a very close friend of mine from our church. I tried to make it work and after the last emotional affair I couldn't do it anymore. I filed for divorce just over 2 years ago. We are still going through the divorce and she's been high conflict the whole time. She's painted herself as a victim and I go a new church but still have some friends at my old one (I attended there for over 30 years). \n\nMy Petty Revenge:\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating since January. She's aware of my situation and we are having fun. I have older kids and she has younger kids. For labor day, we both had the day off and wanted to do something fun. I mentioned that my old church does a picnic every year at a park. There are games and activities for the kids and a big potluck bbq. I told her my ex would like be there but it's a big event and we could keep to ourselves. I'd also be able to introduce my gf to friends from my old church. \n\nMy gf made sure she was extra cute, we had matching socks and I wore a shirt that said \"built for conflict\" on the back. We got to the bbq, my gf made a desert to share and I was grilling. \n\nMy ex saw us and looked beside herself. She eventually came over and tapped my gf on the shoulder and said \"I'm \" ex's name\", I'm \" my names\" wife.\". My gf said \"nice to meet you\" and held out her had to shake my exes. My ex then said \"it's awkward for you to be here and I hope you feel that way\". My gf responded \"ok\" and my ex walked off. \n\nLater my ex approached me and said \"this isn't your church anymore, I think you should leave\". I said \"not gonna happen\" and kept walking. She went back to her friends (my old friends) and was just distraught. \n\nShe eventually asked the pastor to ask me to leave. He's my best friend and was the best man at my wedding. He came and \"talked\" to me so he could tell her he did. I told him she needed to grow up and I wasn't leaving. \n\nHe went back to my ex and she was unhinged trying to say we had to leave. She tried to make it some spiritual thing. Eventually she gave up and went to the friend she had an affair with and his wife to be comforted (they are still friends, I didn't get it). My gf and I just watched and laughed. \n\nMy ex has been terrible this whole time and whatever control or narrative she though she had was destroyed. Everyone watched as she just acted like a witch and we smiled and waved. \n\nIn the end, the kids had fun, we got to catch up with old friends, and my ex wife got put in her place. It was a good day. \n\nSide note:\n\nMy gf is stunning and several people just stopped with a dumbfounded look on their face when they saw her. Was such a flex to people who want to see me fail. ",

Obviously he thought the worst, including UTI, hernia, and was even scared he could have HIV/AIDS because he's a barber and is scared of blood borne pathogens (he's a hypochondriac too lol). Well a 5 hour hospital trip later, and turns out that he tore two muscles in his abdomen and his urethra was swollen. Then I remembered vaguely that we had some pretty *rough* drunk sex the other night that was very intense and vigorous from what I recall. Now no sex for 30 days lmao and he says it hurts so bad he can't pee and getting hard is painful. \ud83d\ude2d\n\nTLDR: broke my husbands weiner during rough sex and he ended up in the hospital thinking the worst \n",

    "title": "Anyone surprised that Mihawk doesn't have Conquers Haki isn't reading the same manga ",
    "selftext": "Let's break this down just a little bit.\n\nMihawk has never been one to go around and talk about how he's the greatest swords man ever. It's always other people who say it when he walks near them or shows up to certain locations. He's for sure cocky about being the best swordsman, we can see that when he is fighting Zoro during the Baratie Arc. \n\nBut there are things to remind us that he doesn't want to chase titles or conquer anything.\n\n1. The panel above explains that he would rather live in peace and let buggy be the face of the new emperor. He doesn't care to have that title or ambitions similar.\n\n2. When he becomes the world's greatest swordsman he looks for a very secluded place for his residence, Shikkearu Kingdom or what we now call Gloom Island. And island that no one wants/can live on anymore because of it being over ran by the apes and other creatures that love there. Again he's seeking a sort of peace. \n\n3. In Volume 108 sbs we learned why Mihawk became a warlord. Mihawk chose to become a warlord to ensure he could live in peace and exclusivity without being constantly chased by the marines, I mean I can still kill these guys with relative ease but again he wants peace. \n\n4. My Favorite point, I think Mihawk is actually looking forward to the day when someone can finally beat him and take his title. I get this feeling from reading the end of the Baratie, where he challenges Zoro to go out there and see the world and get stronger and strive to pass him. I think he wants to hand the title over to someone else so people won't come seeking him for more challenges and he can finally, again, have peace. \n\nThere is probably more examples I can pull up but I don't want to be painfully redundant more than I already am. \n\nThe point of this is to show that if we take the qualities of previous conquers we can see that Mihawk doesn't line up with them. There is no doubt he is one of the strongest in the verse, for sure he's clappin soooo many cheeks when it's comes to fighting but his ambition is not that of a conquers thus I thought this whole time, it would make sense that he doesn't have conquers haki. \n\nThanks for reading.\n\nAll the Mihawk fans are gonna slaughter me here bit I still have him top 5 ",

    "title": "AITAH for going on a girls trip instead of taking care of my husband after surgery?",
    "selftext": "I (24 F) have been planning a girls trip with my sisters and two friends for the past year and a half. We spent two weeks in Greece and I just got back yesterday. Several months ago my husband was told he needed his wisdom teeth out and was given several surgery date options. One for three months ago, one for the week I would be gone, and two or three  options in October. The clinic was pretty booked out and my husband was in some pain so I suggested he take the soonest available appointment to not only get it over with but fix his pain sooner. Plus I\u2019d be out of the country the next available one. \n\nHe didn\u2019t want to take the soonest one \u201cbecause it was too soon and he wasn\u2019t mentally prepared\u201d and I assumed that meant he\u2019d just wait till October. My husband informed me three weeks before I left for my trip that he had booked that time slot and he\u2019d need me to stay home and take care of him. I told him that wasn\u2019t happening and he needed to either pick a later date or have someone else help him. \n\nWe fought but ultimately it was decided my mil would come take care of him and I\u2019d still go. Over the trip I spoke to them both a few times and his surgery went fine and I continued with my trip. When I got home my MIL confronted me saying how horrible of a wife I was and that I had neglected my husband and chose my friends over him. My husband is still angry and his entire family is pissed at me.\n\nI feel like he had several options and knew fully well that I wouldn\u2019t be home on the date he chose. That he sprung it on me way too last minute to change my plans or get any kind of refund and I made it clear I would be going.  He tried to justify it by saying the first date was too soon and the later dates were too far away and I had to understand that he could only do that week. AITAH? \n",

    "selftext": "Hi gang!\n\n**Backstory**\n\nI live in a town in the Netherlands with a university and a few years ago my gf's cousin got accepted as an overseas student. My gf is Japanese, her family (father, mother, her sister and herself) moved to the Netherlands while she was younger. Her cousin still lived in Japan when she applied, got accepted and is now living in a student room in the Netherlands. We don't really have dorms here like in the US, but the building she lives in is maintained by the university itself.\n\nSaid cousin is doing quite well for herself, got good grades and is well on her way to get her diploma. Partly because of this the overseas family decided to have their vacation in the Netherlands this year, both for leisure and a bit of a family gathering.\n\nThis story takes place during the family gathering. My gf's parents and the cousins parents plus yet another family had a meeting in a restaurant in my hometown. They had 2 little kids in tow (sisters), these looked like 8 or 9 or so to me but my gf later told me that they are actually 11 and 12 but did look younger than they were, probably also because of their school uniform (at least that's what it looked like to me, I really don't know).\n\nAnyway, the idea was to catch up with the family and my gf was asked if she would be willing to keep the two young kids busy for a few hours since she was the oldest of the lot... my gf and me are in our 40's, her studying cousin is around 25 and as said.. the two kids are around 10 (11 and 12). My gf didn't mind but did ask me if I wanted to come along as well. Her cousin didn't mind (the three of us had met a few times before already) and well, it was all about keeping the young kids busy anyway.\n\nOh, for the record...  the two young kids basically only speak Japanese, they do understand bits of English and can even speak some but it's mostly Japanese. My gf's cousin speaks both Japanese and English and has even learned quite a bit of the Dutch language as well (seriously... for the few years she's been here it's IMO quite impressive). My gf speaks Japanese, English and Dutch and as for me... Dutch (obviously) and English, but over the years I also managed to pick up a decent bit of Japanese as well and I can often (not always!) understand the general jist of things, as long as it's not too quickly spoken or too complicated.\n\nSo basically it was all English and Japanese between us.\n\n**A bully shows up**\n\nWe took the kids for a walk through my home town and they were quite interested, but when we went past a playground... that also quickly got their attention. So the three of us decided to go sit on a bench and let the kids have some fun. There were several activities like an air balloon castle, swings, a sandbox for younger kids to play in... just plenty of things to do. The two wanted to go into the castle which was fine with my gf as long as they made sure to only use the entrance/exit which was located on our side so that they wouldn't get lost and we could keep track of them.\n\nThe three of us talked quite a bit but also kept eyes on the castle. So... around 15 or so minutes later I spot the two again by accident near the exit with a little kid in between them. I have no idea but I'd say she was around 8 or so?  I can't really tell exactly what's going on but I did see the kid point to the area of the sandbox and that's where the three of them headed next.\n\nBefore I can say anything to my gf a young lady walks up to us and asks (in Dutch) if we have seen a little girl passing by. This seems way too coincidental to me so I ask: \"*Is she wearing a pink dress by any chance?*\", the woman's face lights up as I tell her that she seems to be with my gf's younger cousins and I point to the sandbox.\n\nBut when we look over we now also see an older boy near the girls (I'm not good with guessing ages, let's just say that he was bigger than them?) and he's clearly harassing them. The small girl is visibly crying but also comforted by one of the two younger cousins while the other is keeping the boy away from her.\n\nWe all walk over to the sandbox just when the boy manages to shove one of the cousins out of his way and he's clearly trying to bully the young girl (in the pink dress), but now stopped by the other cousin. Which is when we arrive. The woman who is with us berates the boy and tells him to stop picking on young children. But the little brat clearly isn't very impressed.\n\n**The incident**\n\nNext moment his mother (so I assume) storms over yelling, and she has every appearance of a Karen. Or... a \"Tokkie\" as we tend to call them over here. A little argument ensues, mainly between the mother of the girl in the pink dress and our Karen/Tokkie. It goes back and forth but it's apparent that according to his mother the brat did nothing wrong by picking on a girl half his own size and this \"fine\" example of a mother even has the audacity to blame the other mother for \"*raising such a weak little 'c-word'*\". Basically...  \"*Dat krijg je ervan als je domme huppel 'katjes' opvoedt*\".\n\nAnd then the Karen says: \"*Kids will be kids, just let them sort out their own problems already!*\", but she does take the boy with her as she walks away.  The mother gets ready to grab her kid and leave, but in the mean time the girl has completely calmed down and is actually having a great time with the two cousins.\n\nUnknown to anyone else yet at this time my gf decides to comply with the earlier suggestion.  First she asks the mother to reconsider leaving because the kids are having so much fun together. My gf also comments how amazing kids are because... they clearly don't speak the same language yet they seem to understand each other just fine and are having a good time.\n\nThe mother agrees and my gf now addresses both her cousins in Japanese. And it sounded *very* serious to me, something about the tone, the way she talked and also looked at both girls ... even a bit sternly. They both nodded, and clearly said \"*haaai*\", aka \"Yes ma'am!\". I think I even saw a small head bow, but I'm not too sure.\n\nOur little group goes to sit on a bench nearby and for the next 5 minutes nothing happens. We're just having some smalltalk.\n\n*Then the bully returns.*\n\nThe mother of the small girl wanted to stand up but gets stopped by my gf who tells her that she has nothing to worry about because her kid is completely safe: \"*Just watch, trust me on this*\". The mother is visibly uneasy but does remain seated.\n\nWhich is when I noticed that the behavior and stance of the two cousins has *completely* changed. They seem much more confident and relaxed. The boy starts making a fuss while one of the cousins stands up, points to him and yells something at him (in Japanese, obviously). He, once again, tries to shove her out of his way but this time....  she's faster. She steps aside, does something with her leg and gives him a huge shove. Next moment he's eating sand. No, *literally*.. he gets up visibly angry while his face is covered in sand.\n\nThis time he becomes violent and actually tries to hit one of the cousins with his fists. Yah, *tries*... She evades one attempt, then grabs his hand, spins it around and the next moment the boy finds his arm twisted behind his back and he starts screaming.\n\nThe other cousin now also stands up, pats the young girl on her head, makes another move and once again the boy gets shoved to the ground, this time by both cousins. *Hard..* When he looks up the other cousin actually makes a moving gesture as if she wants to kick him but without actually moving her legs or anything. She's obviously just threatening him.\n\nMy gf pokes me with a huge grin on her face and tells me: \"*Surely that deserves a point for self restraint, don't you agree?*\". She's visibly loving every moment of this.\n\nApparently the boy isn't totally stupid and he runs off, while one cousin immediately turns to the young girl again who is clearly still having a good time. Not at the least upset with the bully.\n\n\"*Wat was* ***dat*** *in godsnaam?!!*\", the mother asks...  Oh, sorry: \"*What the hell was* ***that***\\*?!\\*\", she asks. My gf tells the mother that her cousins are taking the same self defense classes as she and her sister once did, and that she had decided to \"pull ranks\" by telling her cousins that it was ok for them to actually defend themselves   ...as long as they didn't overdo it, of course.\n\nThe mother wanted to know more about these classes but unfortunately for her my gf had to tell her that the actual school was located all the way out in a suburb of Tokyo so... not something her daughter would be able to attend.\n\n**Mommy returns with a \"BOA\" (guard)**\n\nWe're chatting some more for the next 10 minutes after which the bullies mother storms over to us with a \"BOA\" in tow. BOA is Dutch for \"Bewust ongeschikte ambtenaar\", errr... sorry: \"Buitengewoon Opsporings Ambtenaar\" which basically means so much as a being a deputy but without the proper training nor having any weapons. Generally speaking most of them usually handle ticketing people.\n\nHe tells us that he has gotten a complaint from the woman about \"people beating up her kid\" to which the mother of the young girl immediately snaps: \"*Whatever happened with letting the kids sort out their own problems?*\".\n\nNow, the funny thing is... apparently the whole spectacle didn't really go unnoticed and before we could say or do anything someone else had stormed over as well: \"*I saw the whole thing officer!*\", an older woman said: \"*her brat (pointing at the Karen/Tokkie) was harassing and beating the kid in the pink dress when those two awesome kids stepped in and protected her*\".\n\nMeanwhile another man had walked over: \"*Officer, that brat got everything he deserved. He started it, the only thing that happened was that those girls defended themselves from him*\".\n\nThe officer listened to everyone's statements, and ended up deciding to ticket the mother of the brat. I assume for disturbing the peace, but I don't know any details because at this time we decided to leave and we went our separate ways.\n\n**Backstory**\n\nDuring our walk back to the hotel / restaurant the cousins told us the whole story. And I actually learned something new as well...  While they were in the castle they saw the boy harassing the young girl in the pink dress and immediately decided that this wasn't right, also because he was almost twice her size. He actually pulled on her hair while she was already crying which made the cousins plain out angry.\n\nBut the only thing they did was get the boy away from the girl... One cousin distracted the boy by blocking him from grabbing the girls hair again and she also started taunting him while the other comforted the young girl and led her to the exit, but... the one *we* agreed on. So the girls mother never saw her leave and got worried. The other cousin managed to lose the boy in the crowd (at first anyway) and she joined her sister near the exit.\n\nSo I asked my gf why they didn't do all that stuff right away, to which she told me that they weren't allowed to. The first rule of self defense is apparently: \"*Always* leave if you can\" and her cousins are at a level where the use of these techniques outside their school is strictly prohibited, unless their's an actual threat of course or....  if they've been given direct permission by an elder of the same school. A rule which my gf was stretching a little bit, but she told me that she would write up the whole altercation so that the cousins could take her letter back with them. She was actually not kidding when she talked about \"points for self restraint\" because that would actually be her advice in the letter.\n\nBut yeah... typical hypocrite behavior ... let the kids sort it out... until it suddenly doesn't go your way, eh?\n\nThanks for reading!",

And that was the end of our relationship, despite my ex wife wanting to make it work and trying to save our relationship.\n\nNow I will say I was really close with her family, especially her brother. We both followed the same sports teams, we worked in the same field, and we got along really well. But after the end of my relationship with my ex wife, I slowly cut off contact with her family too. \n\nLast night, I got a call from my ex wife which surprised me. She was in really heavy tears, and she was mumbling something I couldn\u2019t really understand. I then asked her if she could speak more clearly, and she said her brother had passed away. I was shocked, and for the first couple of minutes I did not know what to say. My ex wife was still crying a lot on the phone.\n\nHere is where I sort of regret what I did. After a couple of minutes, I told my ex wife I don\u2019t care and to never call me again. I then cut the call. I didn\u2019t want to be pulled into this emotional turmoil when I was no longer with her, I had my own life to look forward to.\n\nWas I the AH?",

    "title": "Well Well Well. Everyone Thinks It's Really Weird That Citadel Sold Omnium, a hedge fund servicing company with $70 BILLION AUM, to Northern Trust for $100 Million",
    "selftext": "Post credit: https://x.com/esrbust/status/1831481628050513977\n\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/everyone-thinks-its-really-weird-that-citadel-just-sold-omnium-2011-5?amp\n\nCourtney Comstock May 16, 2011\n\nKen Griffin's Citadel recently sold Omnium, a hedge fund servicing company with $70 billion under administration, to Northern Trust.\n\nApparently people in the hedge fund community are wondering, why would Citadel sell a company that does a lot of its back and middle office work? \n\nWhat's weird is that \"while Omnium wasn't exactly Citadel's back office,\" according to someone familiar with Citadel, \"they were always pitching it as such.\"\n\n\"I have no idea why they would sell it. Rather counter-intuitive.\" \n\nOmnium provided hedge fund services (like accounting, for example) for a variety of third party clients. Citadel owned Omnium and was a client. While a number of their groups had their own back and middle office personnel, other parts of Citadel relied on the company for service, according to our source. \n\nOf course it might not be counter-intuitive to market it using the Citadel name and then sell it at all - Citadel is a big, successful fund. Using the Citadel name to market a company it owns makes sense.\n\nBut still, without a price disclosure, the question remains: why sell it?\n\nCould owning it be perceived as a conflict of interest somehow?\n\nUPDATE: Someone familiar with Citadel tells us that, after Madoff, there's a sensitivity towards due diligence (like that performed by Omnium) being performed by the same company. Future investors might be better reassured by Citadel's due diligence being performed by a separate company outside of Citadel.\n\nAlso, here's more on Omnium: Citadel founded the company about 4 years ago. It created and maintains the technology that Omnium uses, and licenses it to them. At first, the company was more closely involved with just Citadel. Then, it took on other clients. Recently, Citadel re-named the company and moved its offices. And now they've sold it for ~$100 million. Citadel will continue to license and maintain the technology.\n\n*I am surprised an article with Ken Griffin\u2019s name and Madoff\u2019s name has not been scrubbed from the internet yet.*",

    "selftext": "Posting from my main account because posts from my new account get automatically deleted, and I need my voice to be heard as soon as possible.\n\nYou probably read the title, so I am not going to repeat myself. I've played some hoyo games, genshin and honkai. So first thing that took me down the dark path was the trailer, more specifically, Grace's feet. I thought \"wow, this game is crazy\" then decided to download it (for the gameplay, not feet). I enjoyed the game of course,  the gameplay, characters, farming, etc.\n\nI was still rewatching the game and characters trailers, including the one with Grace's feet (the whole trailer, not just the part with her feet), and my reaction to Grace's feet changed every time i watched it. Started from \"haha, that's weird\" to ironically liking her feet to rewinding back to that clip a few times (for the animation in general, not just because of her feet or anything)\n\nThen, the finishing blow came, Jane's character trailer (the one with feet). I loved Jane from the second I saw her character, so I was looking forward to watching the trailer for the first time. So when I finally pressed on the trailer and started watching, I saw her using her feet to lift the viewers head. I immediately paused the trailer and stared at the screen silently, I was stunned. I was looking at the still screen for a few more seconds, admiring (the whole shot, not just her feet). I then resumed the trailer and kept watching in silence. As soon as the trailer ended I rewatched it again, rewinding back to the first few seconds again and again. Anyways, at that point I realized that she changed me completely, and I am a lost cause. \n\nAnyways, I just wrote this to let out my emotions and wanted to know if anyone else felt like that.",
