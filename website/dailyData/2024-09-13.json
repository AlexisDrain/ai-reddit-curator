You are your kids biggest influence in their formative years, you get to decide how they talk to you and other people. Say please when you ask them to do something. Say thank you when they do the thing. Knock before entering their room, and actually wait for permission. Ask before taking something that is theirs, and respect it if they say no; it\u2019s theirs. Apologise if you do something wrong; it doesn\u2019t have to be immediate, but always apologise. Use kind words and a soft tone - if you scream at them when they are young you are teaching them it\u2019s a perfectly acceptable way to speak to you when they are teenagers",

My NOW ex-husband and I had been separated for almost two years.\n\nOn November 23, 2022, exactly one day after our one year anniversary, and one night before thanksgiving, my husband got drunk, angry, and that anger turned to violence for the first time in our relationship. I set our two month old son down on the bed to swaddle him, and my ex-husband grabbed me by the neck to force me to turn and look at him. I fought his hands off of me and he told me I was overreacting.\n\nI put our son to bed in his bassinet and locked myself in the bathroom. I posted to Reddit on a separate account (I was afraid of him seeing it, I wasn\u2019t sure if he knew my account name) asking what I should do. While I was responding to the numerous comments telling me to get out and get out NOW, he started banging on the door and screaming that he was going to kill me. \n\nI opened the door because I couldn\u2019t leave my son and step son (in the living room) out there...",

    "selftext": "You have to shave and clip and scratch and wash and brush and sneeze and burp and cry and fart and eat and shit and piss and puke and cum and scrub and rub and kiss and blink and bleed and fuck and sleep and stress and think (I didn't ask for all these thoughts) and fight and work and birth and dress and breathe and stink (or deodorize), I mean the list is endless.\n\nSure it feels good to do some of these things but that's mostly because you're addressing an issue with your body, or an issue society would have with your body.\n\nI would love to be an alien that only absorbs nutrients through the air and never excrete through various orifices.\n\nI'm glad so many people enjoy doing these things, honestly. The maintenance just outweighs the experience for me. Wouldn't recommend.\n\nEdit: Being a human is awesome too. The upkeep and weird bodily functions can definitely be worth enduring.",
