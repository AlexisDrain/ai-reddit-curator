"selftext": "Yes you read that right.\nLast week I was in Denmark participating in the Sk\u00e6rb\u00e6k Fan Weekend. I had also agreed to meet up with LEGO on Thursday to deliver a set I owned that they were missing from their collection! Pretty special, and I had a great time. :)\n\nI met with Jette Orduna the director at the LEGO Idea House and Signe Wiese Bundsb\u00e6k who is a corporate historian (and on the picture with me, Jette behind the camera).\n\nThe Byggepinner was a plastic building system patented by LEGO in Denmark, but only sold on the Norwegian market back in the mid 1950's for a short time. My set was found in some cardboard boxes that had been in the attic of a Norwegian toy store which closed all the way back in 1959!\n\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/fabianbl/51711639990/in/album-72157698484597301\n\n",

This allowed my dad to be a SAHD &amp; for me &amp; my siblings to get a good education. \n\nWhen I graduated from college I decided to go into the same field as my mom. While I love her &amp; our relationship is good, I very much did not want to only be viewed as her kid, or receive special treatment due to how well regarded she is, so I use my dad's surname, and generally keep who my mom is to myself. I also avoided coming to work for her.\n\nIn my field &amp; country it's generally accepted that people are hired for a trial period, at the end of which either the employee or employer can cut ties with no fines or compensation required. \n\nSo anyway I went to work at one company (again I'll remind you - very niche market, very few employment opportunities). I went in for my trial period and everyone seemed pretty happy with me....",

I bought them this hammock and they love it.  Could one of you Wizards or Witches remove the tv screen and the black rack on the bottom left.  Just clean it up a bit since this was candid.  Best pic I\u2019ve ever taken imo.  It\u2019s worth a whole $5 to me \ud83d\ude33\n\nP.s - I don\u2019t know how it works, but I added a second pic of the window without the tv if that helps ",

The game is more cohesive than ever, the story as insane as ever but clearly with a plan to connect it all, and by far the game has become less janky.\n\nExtremely impressed. There are only a handful of frames that absolutely suck (2 of them getting fixed tomorrow) and everything else is endgame viable.\n\nThoughts?",

I will love to know the brand, where to buy, and the style he is doing.\n\nNo I'm not Republican, I'm goth and love eyeliner. More so eyeliner that looks THAT GOOD on camara.",
