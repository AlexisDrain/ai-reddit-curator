It weighs 720 tons, is 11.73 m high, 11.4 m wide and 2 m thick.\n\nThe heaviest door in the world, is not designed to keep people out, but to protect the outside world from the contents behind it.

And who likes to struggle? \n\nMost students who say they hate math don't REALLY hate it, but instead, they hate feeling like a failure. They hate all these numbers they have to memorize or processes they have to memorize. Nobody told them why it's important in terms they understand, so they feel it's busy work and that's just not fun. So slowly they start to not care until they're forced to care or be retained.\n\nSometimes it's the teachers, or parents, or students. Sometimes it's all three. But the point is that people like success, and dislike failure. Math is one of those subjects where if you didn't do well one year, odds are you aren't going to be good at it next year since each subsequent year depends a lot on the developed skills of the previous year.\n\nIt's a slippery slope. One bad year will lead to a decade of frustration. And almost everyone has a difficult time at one point or another. The problem is other people /mo...",

The label was meant to imply that these critics are falsely presenting themselves as Dragon Age fans, who would know that the series could have been categorized as \"woke\" from its very first entry, which hit the market back in 2009.",
