"title": "Someone should have gotten sued over Kangaroo Jack",
"selftext": "If you grew up in the early 2000s, you probably saw a trailer for Kangaroo Jack. The trailer gives the impression that the movie is a screwball road trip comedy about two friends and their wacky, talking Kangaroo sidekick. Except it\u2019s not that. It\u2019s an extremely unfunny movie about two idiots escaping the mob. There\u2019s a random kangaroo in it for like 5 minutes and he only talks during a hallucination scene that lasts less than a minute. Turns out, the producers knew that they had a stinker on their hands so they cut the movie to be PG and focus the marketing on the one positive aspect that test audiences responded to, the talking kangaroo, tricking a bunch of families into buying tickets.\n\nWhat other movies had similar, deceitfully malicious marketing campaigns?",

I thought we were openly sharing stuff in our lives. This came back to bite me in the ass when I chose to close the date with a hug instead of a kiss.\n\nAt one point, we had talked about future plans and I said I wanted kids and also enjoyed traveling and living in new cities. He leaned in and told me very seriously that as a woman my age, I had limited time to start a family and should consider that when making plans about my future. This lead to a discussion in which I told him that any woman in their early thirties is well aware of their biological clock ticking away and we hear that from a lot of sources which can be burdensome.

Dropping Game 2 against T1 was just a taste of what happens when they face a team they can't dominate mentally.\n\nAnd BLG, even though they had some shaky moments, have still shown they can step up when needed. Their \"underperformance\" may have just been them warming up. G2's read on the meta is questionable at best, and when it comes to facing BLG, they are just outclassed.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to see G2 pulling through today. Reality check incoming because im not jinxing them.",

It took everything in my power not to scream that it was the Republicans who are banning books. How can a teacher support Republican policies, and Trump. Everything they stand for flies in the face of education and caring for our students. Just venting but OMG help.",

But they haven't called back and it's been almost a week. I've never fostered a kitten this young. She's 3.5 weeks and has decided I'm her mommy now. My husband and adult kids have been helping me take care of her and have tried naming her but nothing sticks. Right now she's just \"the baby\".

I even stayed home from work today so I could help clean and maybe even ask her to show me how to clean. Anyways she walks into my house, stands there a moment and then says she can\u2019t do it.

It's your decisions to spend 400 millions on a game, instead of 'just' 200 or 100. It's your decision to have a vast open world, it's your decision to have state of the art photorealistic graphics (and I love realistic graphics, but even then you can have a cheaper version of realistic that still looks good) and it's your decision to have a marketing budget that is as big as the development cost.\n\nIt's all in your hands, so don't come here to me crying that developing games is unsustainable, when it's entirely your decision to have such bloated budgets, all while AA games show you that you can provide a good experience for a lesser price.",
