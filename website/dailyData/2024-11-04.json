She has four kids (two daughters, two sons, ages 11-16) from a previous relationship, and I have one son, who\u2019s 10. Since day one, I've treated her kids as my own and done my best to support the family. Financially, it's a big load, but I\u2019m happy to do it. We live together in a five-bedroom house, where each of her daughters has their own room, her oldest son has his own, and her youngest son shares a room with my son.\n \nThe main issue\u2014and what\u2019s tearing me apart\u2014is how she treats my son. She barely acknowledges him, rarely asks how he\u2019s doing, and generally acts like he\u2019s invisible. Tonight, it hit a breaking point. We were celebrating her daughter\u2019s 11th birthday, and everyone was gathered to sing and take pictures. I t...",

"selftext": "I live in a relative liberal bubble, but today I witnessed two white women being unnecessarily aggressive towards an Asian family at a children's play place, all because two toddlers want to play with the same toy. On top of being verbally aggressive and getting staff involved, they CALLED THE POLICE. They were being hysterical, claiming \"this man and his daughter put their hands on my CHILD!\" (They did, but in a completely harmless way, and they've apologized repeatedly). The Asian dad was trying to explain but clearly getting upset and worked up and it could have ended badly. One of the women who was acting completely entitled also took pictures of the family with her phone. Anyway I was already a ball of anxious fury over the election and time change and everything else so I stepped in to tell the staff what I witnessed and got into a bit of shouting match with the aggressors. Eventually I filled out an incident report and left. \n\nBUT MY POINT IS: When I told my husband what had ...",

Very good pattern but I messed up my first pair by not adding a lining. That wrinkle in the middle is from me layering some fabric on top of my mock up and not sewing down the boning channels. I was mostly afraid of the lines taking away from the pattern if the fabric, but I\u2019m still really happy with them! \n\nThe Skirt: I honestly saw a picture I liked on Pinterest and just figured it out from there. I bought some bedsheets and cut 4 big triangles and one smaller one and just added some channels with the seam allowance in the middle panel for ruching. Then I gathered and added a simple waistband. Then lots and lots of ruffles! This was my favourite piece of this entire costume. \n\nThe Chemise: The fabric I chose for this was honestly terrible to work with. Super slippery and hard to mark, but so beautiful. I\u2019m not sure what it is honestly. But it was just a simpl...",

Because, remember, when I was hired I was the only Black writer. Lorne wanted to have somebody Black on TV at night-time. People didn\u2019t want that. They were clamoring to make it all white. He didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n&gt; During his five-year run on the show from 1975 to 1980, Morris pushed back at attempts to pigeonhole him into stereotypical Black roles.\n\n&gt; \u201cIt really threw me when we were going through the first show,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a skit, but I was watching another one. I said to Lorne, \u2018There\u2019s a doctor in this skit. Why don\u2019t I play the doctor?\u2019 And he says, \u2018Garrett, people might be thrown by a Black doctor.\u2019 Now mind you I had come from New Orleans, where you\u2019re surrounded by Black medical doctors and Black PhDs.

In March 2023, I (alongside four other patients and two doctors) [sued Texas](https://reproductiverights.org/case/zurawski-v-texas-abortion-emergency-exceptions/zurawski-v-texas/) over the abortion bans after being denied an abortion of an unviable twin, which would have protected me and our viable twin.\n\nI was one of the women featured in the Diane Sawyer and Rachel Scott documentary, [On the Brink](https://www.hulu.com/series/impact-x-nightline-on-the-brink-6908932d-1ba7-46ec-84d9-499cfcdf8e28?dl=false), and a more in-depth look at our case was the subject of the recently-released documentary, Zurawski v Texas.

I don't help enough, so after work the only thing I have time to do is make dinner and do laundry while my wife has to do all of the hard stuff alone. She's always throwing this in my face and most of the time I can accept it since it's a valid argument but sometimes I just lose my patience and yell back. Last week was one of those times and I said something really hurtful and she started smacking me and I tried to sit down because it usually makes her less angry and then she just starts choking me, I can't remember if I tried to get away or if she pushed me either way she told me hit my head on the counter and then the floor and I passed out. My daughter was in the room and saw everything she had never seen my wife hurt me in any way so she was hysterical when I woke up because she thought I died... \n\nThings have been pretty neutral between me and my wife these past ...",

"title": "Giving away Costco Paldean Fates Tins",
"selftext": "Hello everyone!\n\nI\u2019m doing a giveaway to three members of this subreddit community due to the recent events at Costco and these scalpers.\n\nI managed to get 3 boxes of Paldean Fates because the scalpers grabbed all the 151 within 5 minutes of the store opening and the employee putting the pallets out. I was absolutely disgusted by these people having 15+ boxes in their carts and just walking away to eventually resell them (maybe some people will rip them but I highly doubt it). I\u2019ve already expressed my concerns and complaints to the employee putting out the pallets, other Costco members who were bewildered by the flock of people getting these boxes, and the receipt people as I was leaving the store. I\u2019ve already expressed that they should set a limit to 3 and hopefully they do so soon since none of the people I\u2019ve talked to realized how big this was.
