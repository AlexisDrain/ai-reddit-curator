The price was now $800.\n\nFuck no. That's the same price per issue as in a kiosk. So I canceled.\n\nThe next week, I saw an ad for the paper. Intro offer! Ten issues for $1.\n\n\"They have a system in place, of course,\" I thought. \"It will be unavailable for me.\"\n\nBut it wasn't. I was able to buy the intro subscription.\n\nAfter ten weeks?

"selftext": "I was driving to a mall when I saw a mom cat and her kittens out on the side of a busy road. She was very skittish, but with the help of her kittens, I managed to lure her into a carrier. I took them back to my place and am keeping them in a small extra room I have. Mom is a bit on the skinny side and was very eager to eat (hence the little food crumbs all over the room). They have a vet visit in a few days, so for now I'm just keeping them comfy in this room until they get a clear. I'll at least be fostering so they won't be going to a shelter. 3 kittens in total were found, and they were all together. I looked around for about an hour and didn't find any other ones.",

I posted him on our community app and gave him a collar with my number on it in case someone was missing him or he had a primary home, nothing.\n\nHe followed me inside one day (maybe curious about this place the treats seem to come from) and decided he liked it. He comes outside with me a few times a day to roll around and claim the yard while I sit on the porch, then saunters right back over to the front door when he\u2019s satisfied.\n\nThe vet confirmed he doesn\u2019t have a microchip, so he got his shots and some flea meds and I guess he\u2019s here to stay.",
