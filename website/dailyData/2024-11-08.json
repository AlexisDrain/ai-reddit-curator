My wife (44F) and I (45M) have been married for 14 years. We have two kids a 16-year-old son (let\u2019s call him Noah) and a 12-year-old daughter. We\u2019ve had our fair share of disagreements over the years ofc, but things have generally been smooth between us.\n\nNow for the context Noah came out as gay about a year ago. It was a surprise, and as hard as it was to accept, I love my kids more than anything and just want their happiness. My wife visibly didn't take it well tho. She was upset and seemed to go through a grieving period where she didn\u2019t really talk about it. I tried to support Noah in every way I could, telling him that I loved him no matter what etc. My wife, though\u2026 I could tell she wasn\u2019t on the same page. She would say things like \u201cthis is just a phase\u201d or \u201che...",

But shockingly, *so do men*. Can't think of any issues that are unique to men? If you're like me, at first you might be stumped. And that's the problem.\n\nJust a few examples: \n\n* Men account for 75% of suicides in the US\n* 70% of opioid overdoes deaths are men\n* Men are 8 times more likely to be incarcerated than women\n* Young men are struggling in schools and are increasingly the minority at universities, opting out of higher education\n\nFor some reason the left seems to think it's taboo to talk about these things, as if addressing men\u2019s issue...",

When the ambulance arrived I stepped back and watched my friend being worked on. They took him away to the hospital and 15 minutes later, we were told that he passed away.\n\nThey put this mechanical strap around him that would give CPR. It was very violent. When I was giving CPR I could feel his ribs crack. I remember thinking when they were working on him that he is going to be mad when he gets back that I broke his ribs. \n\nWe are announcing it to anyone else in the company till tomorrow, so I needed to tell someone. \n\nThanks\n\nEdit: Thank you for all your kind words.

That lying is an abomination of God. That Jesus taught to follow the laws of man and God.

She still uses my preferred name and pronouns but has removed all that explicitly refer to me as trans. She explained that she thought it would make me safer and I understand that, but I'm proud of who I am and I don't want to ever hide that.\nI'm conflicted on how to deal with the situation because I know she only wants the best for me but I also believe that now it is very important to not back down. I don't treat me being trans as something to hide but my family is siding with her.\nAny comments would be greatly appreciated and I'm  sorry for the terrible writing lol.",
