I just went with my gut and ripped out of there, got a picture of the cat quickly then raced a few blocks to get a picture of the truck. I posted it to a local facebook group and contacted the police. The cat was recovered safely and the owner of the truck was identified and a warrant has been issued. \n\n",

I remodelled my 1966 bungalow from top to bottom thinking we\u2019d spend our entire life here and that we\u2019d never move out of it\u2026 except if this one came on the market. Well I saw the listing October 1st, visited the 5th, made an offer the 6th accepted right away, put mine on the market the 15th and sold mine the 28th. What a month! We finalized the sale this week. It has so much potential, incredible natural light and the curb appeal of my dreams! Some unfortunate paint choices and renovations throughout but nothing major. One bathroom with original tiles! I can\u2019t wait for us to get to work :)",

I received direct messages from a startling number of men who have dated or married a woman with similar issues as Claire.\n\nOne of these messages led to a conversation, and something the commenter said really resonated with me: he told me that in his case, his wife doesn\u2019t really understand the concept of guilt. She doesn\u2019t understand phrases like \u201cYou made me feel sad when you said X,\u201d or \u201cThe way you treated me hurt my feelings.\u201d He eventually came to an epiphany that while trying to make her understand guilt and feelings was a waste of time, she actually had a good grasp on shame, and he was able to leverage that against her.\n\nMy next run-in with Claire happened when we went out to dinner two weeks after Kevin\u2019s play.

This plan suggests establishing an 800-mile demilitarized buffer zone along the current frontlines in Eastern Ukraine, which would be monitored by European troops from the United Kingdom, Germany, and France.\n\nAs part of the agreement, Ukraine would agree to suspend its ambitions to join NATO for a period of 20 years. In exchange, the United States would continue providing military aid to Ukraine, offering logistical and defensive support. However, under this proposal, the U.S. would not commit to sending American troops to the region, nor would it directly finance the operational costs associated with the buffer zone and the European forces maintaining it.\n\nThis approach is reportedly under review as a diplomatic solution to address the ongoing tensions in Ukraine without involving direct U.S. military intervention....",

He went back to his hotel with his actual phone perfectly safe and in his possession, and since it has one of those phone wallet things he still has all his credit cards too\n\nI don\u2019t know where he got the idea, but his experience convinced me to do the same. Grabbed an old iPhone off eBay with a cracked screen for $25. Putting an old case on it and keeping it with me when I travel now.\n\nETA 1: I don\u2019t know exactly which part of town he was in. I could guess based on my own past experiences but they\u2019d only be guesses. I\u2019ll ask him next time we talk.\n\nETA 2: Honolulu is a great town, but it\u2019s also still a real American city, and yes they have crime too. My brother got mugged. It happens.

"selftext": "My 12-year-old hen, Sasha, is passing away. Over the years, I've had many chickens of various breeds, some were social, some were wild as hell but Sasha is truly something special. She's incredibly curious, social, and loving. She follows me everywhere when I get home. Whenever I have new chicks to raise, she always takes them under her wing and teaches them her chicken ways. She was the only chicken who would come into my house and hang out with my dogs and I in the living room. Sasha is more than just a chicken; She is the mother and protector of my flock and a true feathered friend.  She is going to be missed terribly.  \n\nI just wanted to share this because I wanted to honor Sasha and knew you all would understand.",

And lost 20lbs that month. I walk on purpose maybe 2-4 miles a day with my dog. \n\nSeptember and October I brought coffee back for morale. In the morning I\u2019ll have my Splenda and creamed coffee and then not eat until dinner. Dinner is always under 20 carbs. \n\nI love barqs zero root beer and have a can everyday (please don\u2019t come at me). I have had plenty of Saturday cheat days but have consistently gotten back to business the day after so I\u2019m still losing weight. You don\u2019t need to be perfect you just need to be consistent.\n\n I had my gallbladder out when I was pregnant years ago and have found taking psyllium husk capsules with my dinner helps with bile acid significantly (ifykyk)\n\nNoticing how small my legs are now and how I feel everyday is enough for me to go on. My energy is insane, I can cross my legs effortlessly....",

"selftext": "I had a friend who found out her husband was having an affair with someone he worked with.  She confronted him and he swore he would end it.  A month later she caught them again.  She decides she is done and proceeds with a divorce.\n\n\nHe was a total asshole and made the divorce as painful as possible, fighting over every little thing.  They both refused to leave the house while the divorce was ongoing, afraid the other one would use it against them.  So they continued to live together until they eventually agreed to sell the house.  While still in the house he expected her to still do his laundry.  \n\n\nShe channeled her inner Satan, agreed to do his laundry, and would periodically rub poison ivy all over his clean underwear.  First time it happened he thought his affair partner gave him an STI.  Her and I laughed over a bottle of wine while she told me about him howling as he took his first oatmeal bath.\n\n\nHe was such a piece of shit and deserved an itchy taint.",

It is pitiful victimization just because these guys made a choice to go to college as a kid. \n\nWhen I went to higher education to learn for the first time, I came with this conception that white collar folks would hate me. No, they thought it was cool what I did before and wanted to even see me in action. I genuinely think Blue-Collar workers have an insane inferiority complex because of this. They are scared of people who are smart, so they demean them. \n\nI think when people start on FB about how *blue collar workers good, white collar workers...",

"selftext": "My ex (M62, now) and I (F64, now) got divorced with one infant child in 1987.  His support until 1992 was $50/month.  He never paid this.  He never worked for a pay check, only for cash.  \n  \nIn 1992 I went to increase his support to be what he would pay if he earned federal minimum wage.  He never paid.  Never saw my daughter after she turned 7 in 1993, no cards, calls, nothing.  Which is good and left our family to be a family!\n\nFast forward to 2004, my daughter is now 18 yo.  I start to receive small child support deposits of $64/week.  I am shocked and dismayed but happy.  A few weeks later I get a call from my ex, Shannon, saying \"isn't she 18 now?  Tell them to stop taking the support.\".  I laughed and said no, you will always owe the back amount, plus interest.  I can't stop it.  So he quits working.\n\nThen no word from him for years.  Comes to 2021 I get a call from Shannon.  Surprised by this I ask why the hell he wants.  He wants me to fill out a form to FORGIVE his past su...",

After reading my post, an alumnus of a Tier-2 b-school approached me through direct message and told me to send my resume to him. The same night I was approached by one of his friend who was looking for a Monitoring and Analytics role for a Foreign Company. And, I finally converted the position yesterday with a 35 K in-hand salary after all deductions. The said company will also give me a chance to complete by MBA through hybrid/distance mode on company expense. I know this offer is not anywhere to your 50-60 LPA packages. But, this is definitely much better than my present situation. I will keep trying for good B-Schools as well. Wanted to share this positive news with you all among all this negativity. All the best and May ...",
