Some hallmarks of these thoughts are that they are unwanted, disturbing, and intrusive in nature. Often, they are completely at odds with your nature, and usually latch onto things you hold dear.\n\nSome sufferers may also find themselves ruminating on said thoughts, trying to wrestle with them and find meaning to alleviate the fear they cause. Some common themes include:\n\nHarming your loved ones\n\nHarming yourself\n\nHarming children\n\nViolent, graphic imagery\n\nEmbarrassing yourself/losing control in public\n\nSudden urges to say horrible things to people\n\nReligious fears, such as unwanted, blasphemous thoughts in prayer or church service\n\nFear of being a sexual predator\n\nFear of cheating on your spouse/partner\n\nFear of losing your sanity\n\nAnd several, several others.

Is he trolling?\u00a0\n\nHe presents it as if the fans have been trying to bait him into fighting someone with these extreme advantages, but he's too smart to bite.\n\nIf Jon thinks it's not impressive for such a \"bigger\" and younger fighter to win, he should take a look back at his own career.

Especially if you had any past traumatic experiences similar to this. Then you have every right to speak about it.\n\nNow I'll be honest, when I also first got into the story, I was also very much put off by THAT scene of Momo with the aliens. But after that, I was having an absolute blast with the story.\n\nSo what I'm saying is that y'all really need to try and give it a second chance. Now yes, this story will be filled with more dirty jokes and quite a bit of \"out of context\" scenes. Which should be expected because the main goal is literally to get the MC's family jewels back to him.\n\nBut they're not as bad as the clip you just saw in the first episode.",

Her boyfriend would feel like something was off, but nothing was immediately obvious because she didn't move just one thing - she moved *everything*. \n\nThe space between the objects was the same, so he would be confused as to why he was suddenly tripping over things, running into furniture, catching his clothes on things, etc. \n\nThe worst part was that she would leave it until he got used to it, and the next time he made her mad she moved it all back an inch in the other direction and the cycle continued. \n\nI honestly don't think he ever figured it out, and I probably would have felt bad for him if she hadn't caught him cheating on her - which led to her freezing his car keys, storage unit keys, etc. ...",
