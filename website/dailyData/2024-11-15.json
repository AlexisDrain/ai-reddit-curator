We had been discussing moving in together and rather than renting a place, she asked me to buy a house with her.  I was 23, just starting my career, I wasn't even thinking about buying a house, but she was so passionate about it.  She had apparently been looking constantly at the market and she found this foreclosed starter home, but couldn't quite afford it on her own.  \n\nWe had literally been together 3 months and in most contexts this just would have been a terrible and insane thing to do, but I was so in love...",

He was super snuggly on the first day, so we think he was dumped because it turns out he has \"wobbly cat syndrome\" aka cerebral hypoplasia. He is an adored and spoiled inside cat now.",

The shelter didn\u2019t have much information on her because she had just came in 10 days ago. She just recently had puppies and they labeled her as a stray.\n\nWhen I met her she was absolutely loving. She came right to me and started licking my face. I asked her to sit and she laid down and turned on her back. I couldn\u2019t help myself so I laid down next to her and she snuggled right next to me and continued to give me kisses. I fell in love right away and proceeded with the adoption process.\n\nI haven\u2019t personally owned a dog before. Growing up my family always had boxers so I\u2019m not new to being around an animal. \n\nNow that I\u2019m going through with the adoption I\u2019m curious if these behaviors will continue or if this is how dogs act at shelters. \n\nI\u2019m really excited to bring her home and give her the love she deserves.",

"selftext": "Seriously, I\u2019ve lived in way more depressing countries &amp; cities and you guys are by far the worst I\u2019ve ever seen with road rage in general. The tailgating despite already being 10-20ks over the limit, aggressive manoeuvres, not letting people merge, not letting people in despite indicating for years, always trying to get \u2018in front\u2019, not keeping left unless overtaking. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any courtesy or patience with you guys, seriously you definitely can get to your destination without being a fuck wit. Yes it might take an extra minute or 2 but you\u2019ll feel so much better. Just relax people and be better ",
