"selftext": "My gf and I have been wanting an all in one washer/dryer after we used a small one at an Airbnb a few years ago. My laundry room is tiny and my house doesn\u2019t have a pantry, so we wanted to try and turn at least half of the 6x6 laundry closet into a pantry. Old washer started going out and that gave the excuse for us to take the first step down the road to the laundry/pantry Promised Land. \n\nThis thing is incredible. It\u2019s SO NICE to start a load, go to bed, and wake up to clean, dry clothes in the morning. There are 3 women in my house, a big dog, and 2 cats- we create a shockingly large amount of dirty laundry. We bought the LG High Capacity 5.0 cubic ft all in one, and it holds an extra full load. Clothes come out sparkling clean and bone dry every time. It can take like 4 hours to do a really big load on the AI Wash/Dry cycle, BUT YOU DON\u2019T HAVE TO SWITCH THE LOAD! Mine also holds at least 15 loads worth of detergent and fabric softener at once and automatically dispenses the righ...",

This was just after WW2 and at the time most of the machines and processes were powered by steam, even the heating. The steam was generated by massive boilers and it was his job to monitor the boilers to make sure nothing went wrong. These boilers could potentially explode, causing great damage. By law the boiler had to be attended at all times and there were shifts that watched them around the clock, even when the factory was closed. They took so long to heat up that it was easier and cheaper to leave them running at night. \n\nAfter about ten years of no incidents the company hired a leading hand who would also act as the Safety Officer. He had been a sergeant in the army and he took his job quite seriously, being quite the disciplinarian. He institu...",

It was almost time to let the customers back into the pool area but before hand, the resort would have us attending the pool clean the area up a bit of old towels etc before letting anyone else back in.\n\nWell, during this cleanup time myself and Carl were picking things up and noted this same Karen was shouting at my friend, trying to get his attention, yelling at him to not clean up her resort towels as she wanted to ensure kept the better area at poolside, trying to \"save\" the seat. \n\nCarl was not responding to her shouts as could not hear her ...",

For context, I (20F) have been dating my boyfriend (23M) for about a year, and everything\u2019s been great.

Around midnight, I woke up and heard voices in the living room. I went to check, and there\u2019s Kayla sitting super close to my boyfriend on the couch, giggling and touching his arm.\n\nI was like, \u201cUh, what\u2019s going on?\u201d Kayla laughed and said, \u201cRelax, I\u2019m just testing him to make sure he\u2019s loyal.
