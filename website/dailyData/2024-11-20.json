I\u2019m a socialist, and I\u2019m very open about my beliefs as a leftist. Even *despite* that, there have been times where my conservative male colleagues will, after knowing what my beliefs are, *still* ask me out. I\u2019m not afraid to tell them that our beliefs aren\u2019t compatible, but they don\u2019t seem to care anyway. I live in the Deep South, so it\u2019s not like there isn\u2019t an abundance of women who are just as conservative as they are. They just seem to ignore them, and I don\u2019t know why they can\u2019t be with each other when most other leftists and liberals I know want nothing to do with them",

I entered as a trainee in 2019 and was so happy to be able to play with such great hyungs until this year. I'm grateful to (ONER) Hyeonjun hyung, who has been through everything with me since I was a trainee, (FAKER) Sanghyeok hyung, who I always learned a a lot from, (GUMAYUSI) Minhyung hyung, who always gave me positive energy, (KERIA) Minseok hyung, who helped me play comfortably, and the team that believed in me and gave me a chance.\n\nIt was an honor to receive so much love as a member of T1, and I'm so sorry that I'm leaving so suddenly, even though they gave me so much love. I still can't believe it, but I'm sorry that the fans must have been very surprised.\n\nI am so grateful to the manager who always took good care of me, and to the team lea...",

We were taking a short break in front of his house messing on our phones when a lady walked up and asked why we were wearing masks, she had a mild point about the masks because of cook houses being in the area before.

Fast forward to today, he's following me around the room, making biscuits as he walks. He's too cute!!",

Radio silence thus far.\n\nFull send, Kiddo, full send!",

I really had to visit the restroom to take care of business and yes, it took me longer than it usually did because of that time of the month. Of course he questioned me on why it took me so long\n\nTired of this old man and his involvement with what I do, when my supervisor never did, I proceeded  to give him all of the gory details about why it took me so long. I gave him the DETAILS, step by step.   Needless ro say, he never meddled in my business any longer. He barely looked at me for the next few months. It was wonderful. ",
