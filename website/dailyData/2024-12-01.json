I always color frostings/baked goods using things that also flavor them, so I worked backwards. The pink cake is chocolate cake with whipped chocolate ganache filling, almond cookie crumbs between the layers (coated with white chocolate), and raspberry Italian meringue buttercream. The green cake is lemon poppyseed cake with strawberry lemon curd filling, milk cookie crumbs between the layers (also coated with white chocolate), and matcha Italian meringue buttercream. There are also some candied lemon slices on top of that one. Both cakes are two layers, 18x13. \n \nI am happy I made them because I wouldn\u2019t have wanted anyone else to, but there were definitely some tears involved! I made and froze the components in the weeks leading up to the wedding, did all the assembly and frosting two days in advance, and added the fruit and edible flowers the day of. This was in June :)",

(Cooking chicken for dinner he wanted to season and cook it differently that what i was making) my 44m boyfriend has a huge problem with it (amongst other things) my boyfriend has a habit of telling me i let my son do whatever he wants and refuses to see anything any other way. Its constantly \"why cant he just eat whats made for dinner\" its not all the time my son does this,its maybe once or twice a month. hes a pretty good eater of my dinners even when they arent the best. On top of it, my son cooks himself breakfast every morning before school, usually 2 eggs a peice of toast and carmelized onions. (Idk hes on a onion kick) and my boyfriend hates it. \nPlease reassure me my boyfriends being rediculous. But aitah for letting my kid cook for himself sometimes? ",

"selftext": "So I have a player who is a Satyr Bard, but he pretends like he\u2019s a wizard. He casts his spells with a boomwhacker that is also his staff, so it\u2019s technically a musical instrument. \n\nWhen the one experienced person at the table said \u201cwhy does the wizard have low INT\u201d I just said he wanted to play a \u201cRizzard\u201d and he\u2019s casting with Charisma and the dude BOUGHT IT.\n\nNow I just rename all the abilities and keep the effects having to do with bards.\n\nSo far nobody has noticed (somehow?) that Wizardly Words is just Bardic Inspiration, and he\u2019s been casting healing spells constantly lmao.\n\nHis whole backstory is that he\u2019s a Magical School burnout and couldn\u2019t pass the classes, so now he pretends to be a wizard.",

"selftext": "So Sigma has an ability called \"Kinetic grasp\" where he creates what is obviously a black hole that absorbs projectiles and converts them into health. It does not work on beams of any sort, be it energy or snow or whatever the hell else. This is by far the dumbest thing about his kit that makes him way too counterable. \n\nIt's a freaking black hole. Light cannot escape it. Snow would be easily absorbed, even if it came out bullet speeds. Beams of energy would be absorbed as well. Electrical currents would be absorbed. EVERYTHING would be absorbed, not just bullets. It irks me that what seemingly is turning into a good half the roster is able to counter him easily. This of course being the mode of counter is just dumb. Let's talk about it!",

I could be wrong. \n\nMen are more logical than women. \n- All I have to say to this is bullshit. We all know this is a load of crap. \n\nMen are better at controlling their emotions because they are taught from a young age to keep their emotions locked down. \n- I agree with the second part but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re better at controlling them. I think they just express them differently- usually with anger/rage.

On this afternoon; however, one of the most senior people at my husband's company comes in and she's like \"yeah, I've seen him around\", \"Nice guy\", typical stuff and then she says, \"...but, y'know I haven't seen him around lately. What's he up to?\"\n\nI just looked at her and blinked a couple of times. Again, they sent out an email announcing my husband's death, so my mind was spinning a bit over the cluelessness and so, I looked at her and said, \"Oh. Well, he's dead.\"\n\nThe color from her face drained spectacularly and she turned and walked away.\n\nMoral of the story- Do...",

Recently I started doing OMAD on Mondays. I've been trying to get in 10,000 steps a day. I started taking a tap class one day a week and I decided that I'll start kickboxing, too, but that will start in the New Year.\n\nSometimes I think that my progress is too slow but then I see these photos side by side and I realize how much I've actually lost. I still have a little way to go to get to my goal weight, but it seems so much more achievable than it did before.",

We were 16, and I told her my favorite meal was Chicken Parmesan. She cooked it for me from scratch, and it was delicious. However, I realized that what I meant to say was Chicken Alfredo. I felt bad that she went out of her way to cook what she thought was my favorite meal, so I didn\u2019t correct her- or myself. \n \nFast forward to now. We\u2019ve been together for 11 years, we\u2019ve been married for 2 years and once a month or so she still makes chicken parm for me because she thinks it\u2019s my favorite. It\u2019s good, but it\u2019s really just not my favorite. At this point, it\u2019s way too late to tell her the truth, right? ",
