I have pretty thick skin and it didn't really bother me at the time, but the more I think about it and how much I love my daughter and would never let anything bad happen to her, it's starting to really annoy me that she said something like that.

Look at the moon, a little up and to the right. There\u2019s something really bright there. Every star tracking app i\u2019ve checked hasn\u2019t shown anything in that spot that it could be. No bright stars or planets, so I don\u2019t know. I know it\u2019s not a plane, i\u2019ve been looking at it for like 10 minutes now. Attached is a screenshot from a stargazing app which has Barnards in the exact right spot, and with about the same light pollution in experiencing right now. Also attached is a very amateur picture I took on my phone just to show you the positions i\u2019m talking about. Is something happening in the galaxy? Anything could help, sorry if i end up being a dumbass",

What would be the Best Option? \n\n(If I\u2019m using Wrong Flair or have Grammar Issues, please tell me and I\u2019ll try to fix them to be more clear) ",

Then I edited little cue cards in like \"What motivates you?\" And \"How did you get your start?\" So the cuts seemed more natural.\n\nThen I recorded nothing but silence, and used that as the background audio so it would transition from the cue card to her speaking. Otherwise, it was awkward to go from the cue card to her immediately giving the answer. There was about a half second of silence between the cue card and her answer, and I had her voice fade in just a little bit so it wasn't so abrupt.",
