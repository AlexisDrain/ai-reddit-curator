I told her (very quietly, because obviously my head hurt) that I had a migraine. She said that wasn't real and I should just go home and let people who were \"really sick\" be seen (not how it works, but ok). I tried twice to tell her to leave me alone, then just threw up on her shoes. It wasn't much because I'd been throwing up before then, but she looked sick and walked away quickly, taking for help and new shoes!\n\nAnd before anyone asks, I didn't go in for the pain. I went in because I was starting to get dehydrated for the vomiting. I got fluids and zofran to settle my stomach.",

And I am talking about TODAY, not 50-60 years ago when it was \u201cnormal\u201d.  Although it was still pretty gross then, imo.\n\nEdit:  Oof, so many butthurt folks in the comments.    I\u2019ll stop responding because I\u2019m bored of it and have better things to do.
