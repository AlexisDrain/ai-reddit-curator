Pic 3 is the final result and pic 4 is the before. I couldn't find the tag on it but the fabric didn't feel like a specialty fabric so I hand washed it in almost cold water with the best thing you can find in a mexican household, ZOTE. After I hand scrubbed it I threw it in the wash on delicate cycle with cold water and a tiny amount of detergent (I washed both so they'd be clean). Then I put it to dry on the delicate setting with the temp on lowest low. And there's my result. Thanks to everyone who recommended vacuuming it first cause I wouldn't have done that lmao. The reason I was gonna wait til Tuesday was cause I had to go to a party with my MIL today but I wound up just skipping the party to clean this(and wrap secret presents). My kids are watched fairly well but seeing as how my daughter is ...",

Her name is Steph.\n\nSteph is a SAHW, and since we got married, she has been incredibly inconsistent with household labor. I work a physically-demanding job, and it would really help if Steph could at least cook dinner more than once or twice a week. Instead, she sits at the dinner table, hunched over her phone for hours a day. She's completely addicted to it, but she refuses to even have a conversation about this.\n\nNow, about twice a year, I have an opportunity to visit a foreign country for work. The nature of the work is to supervise construction and instruct the workers there. The compensation for these trips is always fantastic, and Steph is appreciative when I go because I bring home a pretty fat paycheck after.\n\nThree weeks ago, I was about to depart for two weeks on such a trip. At around 10am, I texted Steph and said that time was tight, but I'd be home at 12:30 to pick up my luggage. I asked her ...",

It\u2019s not a fleeting thought born out of sleepless nights or the exhaustion of tantrums. It\u2019s a cold, sharp realization that I\u2019ve carried with me for years. I know how society views women like me\u2014as ungrateful, selfish, or even monstrous.

I remember telling my college boyfriend at the time that I didn\u2019t see myself as the \u201cmom type.\u201d I was ambitious, full of dreams, and convinced that motherhood was a trap.

Apparently, this photo is also getting viral!\n\nWhat else could be more heartwarming and heartening to see first thing in the morning than this! I have eaten at the other outlets of JK and other brand eateries as well but none of them had anything like this written on my receipt! It's very welcoming to see these guys - Swami Samarth Foods (probably the Franchisee of the particular Hauz Khas outlet) that they felt like paying tribute to the late Atul Subhash in this way. \n\nMy friend spoke to the owner of this outlet as well who happened to be nearby and his words were, 'Not everything is about business to us. That life was important. We can't bring him back, but at least we can put in efforts to spread his name...",

Idk if it\u2019s because this is the first anime I\u2019ve watched or because this anime is especially emotionally charged, but god damn it as a grown ass 20 year old  man I didn\u2019t expect to feel this strong of a connection to a piece of media. \n\nLet me tell you that this shit felt like a heroin shot with each episode. I loved the premise of aliens/ghosts/supernatural yokai type shit, and together it\u2019s really interesting, unique, and unpredictable. I also love the fast paced plot (adhd ahh) as well as the colours and soundtrack they used throughout the show. Sometimes it helps frame a moment or a scene in a way that makes it super easy to feel what was going on inside the character\u2019s heads. Shit felt immersive as fuck, to the point where I started to feel what the character\u2019s were feeling in real time...",

This drunk kid was roaming around talking to himself, and eventually I saw him go up to her. I was watching the whole time to see her body language and see if she was okay, and when I saw her walk away I walked over there and my boyfriend followed. I just stayed in her general vicinity and she walked over and asked if she could wait with us, and I said of course I came over here because I didn't like that you were waiting by yourself and that the drunk guy was bothering you. She was super appreciative and we waited with her until her Uber came. As her Uber got there the drunk guy walks straight up to it and opens the passenger seat and is trying to get in. I walk over there and let the Uber driver know this...",

I worked out an when she found out I was losing weight by accident (my mom let it slip) she said \"heh, I give him a week\", my mom then grilled her and told her I've been going for a month. Those words are at me and i eventually gave up.\n\nThis year I got ejected and another diabetic scare so I took it seriously. Used to be 6'2 300lbs and now 256lbs. My back issues are gone, girls are talking to me more since I don't smell and my personality got better. My mom lost weight too and family meme...",
