Patio furniture to come in Spring!\n\nI **can** afford to stay here solo, but there won't be much left at the end of the month for trips/dating (not that I'll be doing that anytime soon.)..

If you could have heard that howl\u2026 I thought he was gravely injured at first!\n\nHe was very friendly when I approached him and had no visible injuries. I called to him and he happily followed me up to my front door and tried to walk right in!\n\nI set him up in the basement, figuring such a friendly guy must have a home. I\u2019d just keep him until I found it.\n\nWell, he\u2019s still here. It turned out he was an unneutered male anywhere from 2-5 years old with a broken front fang. No chip. Also no home in the area. I scoured Facebook groups, Petfinder, and signs on the streets. A neighbor who had lost a brown tabby that I contacted said he knew this guy, and that he\u2019d been ...",

I wear head scarves and have no eyelashes, feel like I\u2019m pretty identifiable as a cancer patient. Earlier today I was at the grocery and this older woman came up to me with the nastiest tone and proceeded to tell me I\u2019m disgusting and shouldn\u2019t be out in public if I\u2019m sick without a mask. So I told her luckily cancer isnt contagious and she\u2019ll probably outlive me, so she shouldn\u2019t be too worried about it. Was it petty? Yes. But I would do it 1000x over because the look on her face was priceless. She never said another word but the color drained from her face and her eyes were so big. It was worth it. \n\nEdit: thank you all so much for the kind comments. I\u2019ve got one more chemo session left and plan on kicking this cancers butt. \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc I truly appreciate all the well wishes, it means a lot. \ud83d\udc95",

Cue my big mistake.\nWe were at their house for dinner, and after dessert, I pulled her dad aside. I was nervous, so my brain decided to shut down and go on vacation. I meant to say, \"I'd like your blessing to marry your daughter.\" Instead, what came out of my mouth was, \"'I\u2019d like to marry you.\"\n\nThe man just stared at me. I realized what l'd said about 0.5 seconds later and immediately panicked. I backpedaled so hard that I made it worse. I stammered something like, \"I mean, I want to marry your daughter!\nNot you! Unless you're into that! Not that I mean you're not attractive or-oh my god, I'll just go jump off a cliff now.\"\nMeanw...",

I don\u2019t love party planning but when she left and I took over her job duties, the planning all fell to me by default. No one asked, they just assumed. And after what happened last year I told myself no more. \n\nBasically I did it last year out of courtesy but it was difficult. Not just mentally but physically exhausting. I stayed hours late for several days in a row. Thank god I don\u2019t have a family or children.  Basically only the women helped with any of the planning. None of the men did anything except our male boss who paid for it all but all of the actual planning was done by just the women. One helped me plan and order the food and another one helped shop for decoration and wrap all the elephant gifts as best she could. \n\nAt the end of the night I watched as the men waited for the women to start ...",

There were also several walk ins and we were extremely understaffed (loads of staff had taken that 4-finish shift off for some unknown reason).\n\nAnyways, I was the most experienced waiter there as it was mostly new starts working and apart from me, my manager was probably the most senior member of staff there (I\u2019m 17 and I\u2019ve been working there since I was 15, I\u2019m in the UK so it\u2019s fine for me to be working at this age). I am tasked with taking a food order from one of the tables, I go up and take the order and put their order into the tills. I then go to drink from the water bottle which I had filled at the start of my shift and my manager tells me \u201cyour not allowed to drink on shift, it\u2019s far too busy put it down.\u201d So I put my drink down. \n\nThe next day I come in for my 9-5 shift and I don\u2019t drink.

The fact that he has essentially infiltrated the American government to the point he is being suggested for speaker of the house is probably the most insane thing I\u2019ve ever witnessed.\n\nIt is a textbook example of the worship of the wealthy and the unrestricted power of money in the US government. I find it absolutely insane that he can actually sway government officials including the president when he knows nothing about the average American outside of twitter. In a proper functioning government, what he\u2019s done so far would be illegal. \n\nI don\u2019t even see what his goal is , he\u2019s as rich as he can get, he has more power than 99.9999% of humans on earth. He is treated like a super genius visionary by many. I mean what the hell else c...",

"selftext": "Short video featuring Dr. Robert Jacobs, a former U.S. Air Force First Lieutenant, recounting an incident from September 1964. During a missile test at Vandenberg Air Force Base, Jacobs claims to have filmed a UFO intercepting and disabling a dummy nuclear warhead. The video includes his detailed explanation alongside purported footage of the event.\n\nThe authenticity of the footage remains unverified, and its source is unclear. Jacobs has consistently maintained his account over the years, describing how a disc-shaped object allegedly fired beams of light at the missile, causing it to malfunction. He also mentions being instructed by superiors to remain silent about the incident.\n\nFor those interested in viewing the video and forming their own opinions, here's the original Facebook post. https://www.facebook.com/share/v/1D5sFKmc8J/\n\nI don't take credit for this video\u2014just sharing it for discussion and curiosity.
