I always wanted to be a father but never had the chance. I raised her like my own from the moment I met her. There was no blood test that could have told me she wasn't mine. I was there for her first steps. I was there for her first words. I knew what her favorite cartoon was, her favorite color. I read her books at night. I taught her how to ride a bike, how to fish, how to read. I never knew a best friend could be so small, and have a heart as big as the moon. She called me daddy. I called her my princess. \n\nOne day, she told me she didn't love me anymore. She said I was the perfect man and the perfect father on paper. I was loyal, I was kind, I was patient, I was...",

Don't get me wrong he still liked the movie and said it DID \"move him\", I just need something to push him over the edge of tears, yk? What he told me It's apparently honest stories about strong friendships or true love that make him cry, also nothing like purposeful tearjerker (ex: Titanic). Any recommendations? He doesn't discriminate, so can be pretty much anything.\n\nBtw he cried over Futurama, to be exact the part where Leela and Fry read their future together, but that's like the only example I have...",

It\u2019s on a street right next to a very popular park. On the 4th of July, the park was packed and street parking was hard to find. He was away and when he came back to his house, some Karen had parked in his driveway. He decided to park blocking his driveway completely in his rarely used car. \n\nHe then went inside and soon heard a knock at his door. It was the Karen. She demanded that he would \u201clet her car out this very instant\u201d (he said that she stomped to exaggerate every syllable). He closed the door in her face. She called the police and they said that he was parked legally in his own driveway. She got a ride with someone, super angry. The Karen apparently said that if he didn\u2019t move it by the morning, she would call her lawyer. \n\nIn the morning, she came back and demanded the car be ...",

This place is located close to my cleanup from a year ago, where[ I helped clear out a massive illegal dumping site next to  Wilson Ave. in Vallejo](https://www.reddit.com/r/bayarea/comments/1805qa7/i_started_cleaning_up_a_dumping_site_in_vallejo_i/). I am pleased to say that it is still in excellent shape. There is so much debris near the Napa River, that is can be seen from aerial imagery. The risk of it contaminating the river and the San Francisco Bay is high, and I made an attempt to mitigate that through this cleanup. I may need to devise a new strategy since this place is just atrocious. \n\nRegardless, I want to sincerely wish you all well. I understand there is a lot of emotions regarding the politics, economy, etc. My hope is to bring everybody a little ounce of happiness and hope by showing that we have the ability to make a difference.

This is not an estimate\u2014this is a real, statistical audit of the election results, something we've long demanded.\n\n# The findings confirm my hypothesis: there was large-scale electoral fraud in key battleground states in the 2024 U.S. election. This first became evident when county-level data from Arizona showed an unusual lack of statistical variation across 15 counties\u2014something that did not align with the results from 2020. The same pattern was later found in North Carolina, where 100 counties exhibited the same issue. Texas followed suit, with 254 counties showing the same anomaly, except for 4 small counties.\n\nA limited audit from Maricopa County in Arizona revealed similar concerning discrepancies. It showed that 5 randomly sel...",

It took until last week to finally get access to all of her financials. Come to find out I'm listed as the sole beneficiary on her IRA worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. A life changing amount of money. My aunt was unmarried and had nothing else to her name except for a condo. No one else in the family is listed on anything.\n\nMy Dad said the plan is to sell everything belonging to the estate and to split the proceeds up amongst the family. He made it abundantly clear that the IRA is mine and no one else need know about it.
