Before we leave the house, he has a routine of doing physical and mental checks, and these checks have been taking longer and longer. It\u2019s become such a problem that we\u2019re running late to almost everything. I\u2019ve gently encouraged him to seek professional help, but he refuses and insists he can manage it on his own.\n\nTwo weeks ago, we were invited to a dinner party at a restaurant hosted by my boss. I was recently promoted, and this was an important opportunity to celebrate and make a good impression. Knowing how long his checks take, I asked him to start getting ready two hours before we needed to leave.\n\nEven with the extra time, his checks still took 30 minutes, and we were running late. I was panicking about showing up late to such an important event, so I told him I couldn\u2019t wait any longer and left without him.\n\nI ended up being five minutes late and told my coworkers that traffic was bad.

He's freaking out asking if I can explain CPR to them. I told them to call the police and that I'd be over in 5 minutes. I speed over and they're both outside crying and screaming. Thankfully the neighbors had them and told me that both the parents were inside on the floor.

I've not only seen some messed up stuff, I've caused some messed up stuff. In that job you get a lot of medical training because we're the nurses for the medic when he's kinda busy.

"selftext": "This sweet man never had an enemy, beloved by every animal that crossed his path. He has been with us for 19 years. I opened my front door to walk outside and he walked in as a kitten - just walked in like he knew the door was opening and he was already mid-stride. He moved with us 8 times, 4 different states. Never had a single problem, absolutely just a drama-free lover boy. For at least the last 12 or so years, his sleeping spot has been my pillow, wrapped around my head. But this is only after the sleepy time ritual of pressing his spine into the side of my face while I laid on my back, my arm supporting his body and my hand resting on his chest. Every night I would listen to him purr until the purr ran down and then it was just his heartbeat. That heartbeat is gone and it\u2019s taken a part of me with him. He was my soul cat and I\u2019ll love him for the rest of my life. ",

There\u2019s a Sunday surcharge, a public holiday surcharge, a \u201chandling fee,\u201d and now even \u201cincluded tips\u201d as a standard line on the bill. It feels like every other meal comes with an extra fee tacked on for just existing.\n\nI get that running a business has costs, but isn\u2019t this what the menu prices are for? Why are we being hit with hidden extras after the fact? It\u2019s making dining out unnecessarily expensive and frustrating.\n\nSurely I\u2019m not the only one who feels this way. Can we stop normalizing these ridiculous add-ons? Thoughts?",

Saw the cars parked outside the farmhouse and there was rarely any car that costed less than 1Cr, from Porshe to Defender, GWagon Mercedes people had come in such cars and we felt like we came in the wrong car and were probably underdressed. \n\nWe entered the party and they had hired 2 valets to park your car, decorations, people to welcome you and guide you, waiters, premium alcohol, unimaginable variety of food and snacks, I had never even seen that in lavish weddings before. \n\nWe talked to a few people around, saw few people and everyone there was a mill...",

I ended up abandoning the game for about six months after this mini boss. Later, I noticed people kept talking about it and posting videos about how amazing the game is, so I decided to give it another shot. I enthusiastically learned the mechanics and eventually discovered the Mikiri Counter, which is incredibly effective against spear enemies. I practiced it, got excited after successfully performing my first Mikiri, and ended up playing for 24 hours straight. Now, this game is my only 10/10 game and the only one where I\u2019ve completed all the achievements.",
