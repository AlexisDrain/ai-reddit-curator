I won't post the link as to not have this post deleted, but it contained the players who participated, their tournament records and their decklists. All info that would be of HUGE interest to so much of the player base that participate in PVP. On top of that, the user who made the post wrote a really digestible post summarizing highlights of the tournaments, including how certain decks performed and even interesting plays that occurred during the tournament. Idk if the mods just deleted the post without asking the OP to remove the link, but seeing this occur really makes the vibe of this subreddit start to make sense. ",

"selftext": "Dude!!! This is it!!  This is the reason that they are here!   The first communication that they could read from Jimmy and they knew his time was coming and wanted to be here to see his life force move into the galaxy.  As I have said before, they share only one emotion with us.  Fear, guilt, suffering, anger, hatred are completely foreign to them.  They only understand Gratitude.  Jimmy was full of gratitude.\n\nIn my opinion, they either explore this planet and give it a chance (it\u2019s like looking at your dog and the excitement he has in his face when he sees you and you want to give him every opportunity to feel that feeling.) Or, they walk away and allow us to destroy ourselves because we\u2019re not worth it.\n\nI hope it\u2019s the first.",

When I was 7, something traumatic happened while I was with my \u201cfather.\u201d As a child, I didn\u2019t understand it and just carried on, though it caused major anxiety.\n\nIt took me 12 years to tell my mother. Her response? \u201cIf you never said anything, it\u2019s your problem. I\u2019m making lunch for your brother. Are you hungry?\u201d She wasn\u2019t being cruel\u2014she\u2019s emotionally immature and didn\u2019t know how to handle it.\n\nThe next day, my amazing boyfriend (who I\u2019m still with years later) showed up at my doorstep, whit a plushie and McDonald\u2019s to comfort me. \nMonths later, I learned my grandma experienced something similar at 5. \nHer mother, my great-grandmother, confronted the monster, beat them up, and made sure everyone knew what they\u2019d done.\n(It was the 1950\u2019s.) \n\nThat story made me realize: when I told my mom, I didn\u2019t want revenge, gifts, or attention. I just wanted a hug.\n\nIf you\u2019re reading this, I\u2019m not looking for validation or sympathy,...",

Jake recently got engaged to his long-term girlfriend, \"Laura.\" They\u2019ve been planning a big wedding for next spring, and since I have a higher-paying job, I offered to help cover some of the costs, including the venue deposit, which was a hefty $5,000.\n\nHere's the thing: for the past year, I\u2019ve been in a relationship with one of Jake's best friends, \"Tom.\" We kept it secret because we didn\u2019t want to cause any drama in the family or the friend group until we were sure about our relationship.\n\nLast month, during a family barbecue, Jake noticed that Tom and I were being a little too friendly. He pulled me aside and started interrogating me. I admitted we were dating but begged him to keep it quiet, as Tom and I planned to tell everyone when we were ready. Jake seemed annoyed but said he\u2019d keep it to himself.\n\nFast forward two days, and Jake d...",
