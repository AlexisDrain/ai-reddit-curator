"selftext": "\nMy (34M) girlfriend (35F) started having chills and a runny nose on Christmas It got worse to eventually she could not breath due to fluid filling up her lungs. She has asthma already so it even worse from there till ambulance came and took her to the ICU where they had to put her on ventilator at max oxygen and said she has influenza A . They then put her to sleep. I am scared of losing her she is the love of my life and I don\u2019t think I can handle if anything happened to her. Can someone please give me some reassurance she\u2019s going to be ok.  I saw her laying there with tube sticking out of her jugular and they said they had to paralyze her. They told me it will probably be a week before she\u2019s can be awake and that it will get worse before it gets better. They said as long as her oxygen stays above 90 she will be ok. Last I looked she was at 98. I\u2019m just trying to stay positive but I\u2019m feeling powerless and alone\u2026 I just want to hear her voice again\n\n\nEdit : Thank you all so much y...",

She was the sweetest, snuggliest girl who was friendly to everyone she met. She loved ice cream, popcorn, tuna, and cheez-its. She loved laying in the sun, rolling around on concrete, and eating grass under the deck. \n\nI had my first baby in August. I think the held on till now because she knew I could handle being a mom to a human now without her. It\u2019s like she waited to make sure that I was going to be okay. Having to make the decision to let her go was excruciating but I am forever grateful I got to hold her in her last moments. \n\nI will love and miss you forever, my sweet girl. ",

However I noticed my bank account was getting lower and saw charges for Uber eats literally almost every other day sometimes multiple times a day. At first I thought it was fraud and was going to dispute. But something was telling me to ask my boyfriend if he used my card. He admitted it and said he was sorry.\nIt's not like he thought I would be ok with it bc he has called me in the past asking me to Uber eats him something (my guess is he tried to use my card and it declined so he decided to actually ask) he spent about $350 total.

I took a video and showed it to him.  \n\n\n\nHe was furious and told me they were done.  Then he goes to confront her and I don't hear anything until the next day and he tells me \"it was a one time mistake\" so he was going to forgive her, but that this was a betrayal and he didn't like me \"spying on her like that.\"  I pointed out the park they were at is right next to where I park to go to work.  Her affair was during my commute for crying out loud!  He believes that I'm in the wrong somehow.\n\n  \nIt's been weeks and it's clear that our friendship is over.  I'm gonna go drink and play some video games and hopefully get some sleep tonight.  This has been eating me alive inside.",

"selftext": "I was born and raised in Mumbai, lived there through the first 17 years of my childhood. \n\nI had a very abusive mom who neglected me. As a child, I saw Mumbai through her eyes and it was impossible to understand the toxic mess. Then at 15 years old, I had a life-altering event. A politician and his goons physically assaulted me at Centaur hotel. My mom was nowhere to be found when I really needed her. \n\nI realized then, that I had to get independent quickly. Two years later, I hugged my dad one last time at the Sahar International airport gates, never to see him again. He passed away in 2021.\n\nThis year, I finally felt prepared to return back to Mumbai. I had tears in my eyes when my flight landed. The first thing I did was head to Juhu beach for paav bhaaji. Over the next week, I went to all the places I\u2019d always wanted to go and splurged - rooftop bars, cafes, from the best luxurious spots to the cheapest vada pav and bhel puri stalls.\n\nFinally, I got to leave through the same air...",

"selftext": "When I went in for my most recent tattoo on the side of my calf, the artist cut me a bit shaving part of my shin. \n\nIt was hard to tell how bad it was, I thought it just bled a lot. There was wiggle room on the placement so I figured he could avoid the cut easily enough and we carried on. When I looked at the stencil in the mirror, again I just figured it bled down onto me on the walk over. \n\nNow that I've been home a few days and took the saniderm off... I'm kinda shocked and my question is how worried/pissed should I be? \n\nHe got me pretty good with the razor. What I thought was all just blood under the wrap I'm now realizing is all area he hit and he tattooed right through it in one spot. Is tattooing over a razor cut like this not a hugely bad idea...? Or am I worried over nothing?",
