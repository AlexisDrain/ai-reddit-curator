Couldn't find a job no matter how hard I tried, and not having any skills in life or family (was raised in foster care) surely didn't help. \n\nOne day while looking for a restroom to relieve myself, I stumbled across a college that just so happened to have an open house enrollment going on, and figured that was the perfect excuse to enter the building and freeload off their toilets. \n\nLittle did I know however, was that the universe had other plans for me. A guidance counselor had approached me and asked if I was here for open house. Being embarrassed to admit my true intentions, I told him I was and ended up joining him as he regaled the countless opportunities presented before me.\n\nI was intrigued by their surgical technology program, and decided to give it a shot.

After marriage, he gets angry quite easily and yells at his wife whenever something doesn\u2019t go as planned. He has even yelled at her in front of their families and friends.\n\nOnce, we were all having dinner, and he said something to her that I didn\u2019t hear. She replied to him, and all of a sudden, he grabbed her hand and slammed it hard on the table. I could tell she was about to cry. She left the dinner shortly after, and he told us, \"Don\u2019t worry, she\u2019s just a crybaby.\" We didn\u2019t see her again that night. That was the moment I realized something was seriously wrong, and I started hating him for his behavior.\n\nAbout a week ago, he called me, shouting, \"THAT BITCH IS CHEATING ON ME RIGHT NOW.\" I didn\u2019t believe him and told him he was probably misunderstanding the situation.

Other gripes include this being more of a portrayal of Aztec customs rather than Mayan and some timeline stuff but overall this movie is so badass! I recommend it to everyone I know. \n\nWhat do y\u2019all rate it?",

This is my question, one of my daughters (19 yo) had friends up to the cottage and while boating he smacked one of them on the ass which all the girls were disgusted with, very inappropriate, she was wearing a bikini. My second daughter (24 yo) was up last weekend and he said to her \u201cI always knew you would be wild when I saw you riding around on your bike with no underwear. I have not been present to hear these but my daughters told me. My husband said he had a talk with him and he won\u2019t do it again. I\u2019m horrified and want nothing to do with this jerk, I\u2019m I overreacting?\n\nTLDR- my husband\u2019s friend says and does inappropriate things ",

The divorce proceedings took a year, and in that time I did spend a lot of time in the gym and on physical fitness, and by the time the divorce was finalized, I was the fittest I have ever been in my life.\n\nAnd I have had some success on dating apps, I invite the dates over to my house when my daughters are away ...",
