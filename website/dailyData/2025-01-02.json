It was a huge, fancy event, and she spent the past year planning every single detail. One of her main rules was that it would be a child-free wedding. I completely understand and respect that; it's her wedding, her rules.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: I\u2019m a single dad to my son (6M). I don\u2019t have much of a support system, and his mom isn\u2019t in the picture. When I got the invite, I told my sister I\u2019d love to come but explained my situation. I asked if there was any way I could bring my son or, if not, if she\u2019d be willing to help me cover a babysitter for the day since it would require an overnight trip. She shut both ideas down immediately, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not her responsibility\u201d and to \u201cfigure it out like everyone else.\u201d\n\nFair enough. But I genuinely couldn\u2019t find...",

No one was throwing trash around. \n\nIn jam packed places also it was silence, people were not talking loudly, no screaming, things were so calm. Except when an Indian family or group was around. Their presence was felt immediately. One particular group came out with a freaking speaker blaring Indian songs and howling like dogs, literally. This group included sophisticated couples and children as well.\n\nI feel the problem is us Indians.

He was the best cat I've ever known, and I can't imagine a world without him. Every night, he would sleep between my legs without fail. When I had a panic attack, he would curl up in my lap to comfort me. He took so much pride in the treasures he would bring to my windowsill. He loved being outside more than anything. He never bit anyone and was truly the sweetest boy in the world. He lived life to the fullest, even becoming blind in the last year of his life. He was one of a kind. I'll love you to the moon and stars and back, JJ. I'm sorry I couldn't save you. You were the greatest joy of my life. \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83e\ude79",

(At first it was fine but eventually not so much, and he refused to change so things came to a head and ended.) I'm sure after I left he was unpleasantly surprised to discover how much work his assistant did.\n\nAnyway it's been 5 years, we have our own lives and I don't think about him much and we certainly don't talk. But one day I start getting calls from him. He explains to me that he never removed me from his home and auto insurance and says \"they won't remove you unless you call.\" He is pissy and keeps calling me and saying I have to do this right away and being very rude (it's been 5 years and now it's an emergency???

This doesn't even take into account working through holidays, while sick, and not taking time off, but that's just extra math people won't feel like doing anyway, so normalizing to a 40h workweek should be enough.\n\n*edit:\n\nClearly I got the right subreddit for this.

So, in essence, high-paying jobs are outsourced to workers from countries with better systems, while Americans are left to compete for the lower-paying jobs.\n\nDoes anyone else feel like this approach devalues American workers and ignores the root of the issue? Wouldn\u2019t providing those same social systems here benefit everyone and reduce the need to import talent? Curious to hear other opinions!",
