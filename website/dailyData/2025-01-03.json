I am not sure why but it seems a lot of people don't understand how email works so I end up receiving their bank statements, bills, etc. Always from different people (their middle names are always different)\n\nAnyway, I started receiving meeting notes from this random company, spreadsheets, presentations, etc. I kindly replied to them explaining that they have the wrong email. No one ever listened... One day I get added to a group chat (some discontinued Google product) so I joined the chat... I see they start talking  about some customer and start asking questions... I start offering my opinion (I just make it up as I go).\n\nSome of my responses are starting to make no sense... Then I just go full on bananas and start telling them they are all idiots for not checking their emails before sending invites lol. The meeting went sil...",

He had noticed that our guinea pig, Fluff, was happily munching on alfalfa, and it gave him an idea. He took a few of Fluff\u2019s pellets (the guinea pig droppings), and, thinking it was harmless since they only eat alfalfa, mixed them into a bowl of chocolates. He figured that if anyone could tell something was off, it would be me.\n\nLater, when we were sitting together, I reached for the bowl of chocolates without any suspicion. I popped a piece in my mouth, chewed, and immediately noticed something strange. The taste was off... I looked at him, and he pretended to be innocent, asking if something was wrong.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for me to realize that something wasn\u2019t right, and that\u2019s when he finally confessed with a laugh. He told me it was just guinea pig poop, but since it was made of alfalfa, it was completely safe and the he mixed in not only week old poop but fresh...",

I then go to ask the sub if I can go put a pad in. Usually I don't like explicitly telling anyone I'm on my period, but there were already people out of the class.

It was very dated so I figured this was a good time to do it. \n\nI did a full remodel  throughout, new lvp in bedrooms. Closets have new shelves and areas for her shoes. \n\nBut....the kitchen....as you enter the house, the hallway had a closet for coats, so I sacrificed the closet and tore down the wall. \n\nCloset down and I needed the fridge to move to the other side of the room, so that wall had to come down too.\n\nI knew we would lose some pantry space so I installed a pantry cabinet. \n\nThe kitchen had soffits running on both sides and after tearing them out I realized I only had 1 plumbing vent so I installed taller upper cabinets. I will be doing the crown mold in the next month. She needed to move in and I needed to do another project. \n\nI did butcher block counters because I spent too much in the rest of the house and needed to do a cheaper counter...",

I woke up to some DIY curtain bangs courtesy of my 2 year old cat. \n\nThe first 2 pics are from yesterday. She again chewed off a major chunk of my hair while I was asleep in bed. Today, I wake up AGAIN to her actively chewing on my hair. I lost another little chunk that is not pictured here. \n\nWhat\u2019s even stranger as well, is that she is obsessed with licking and chewing on my hair brush too. I have to put it out of reach so she can\u2019t do it. And when I clean my hair brush (like pick out the old hair that\u2019s in the brush) and throw it in the trash can, she will knock over the trash can to get to the hair so she can eat it. I\u2019m not even joking. \n\nWhat is this behavior? I have 2 other cats in the house as well. She is the young...",

I soon discovered that she was muzzled and duct tape covering the muzzle. She was starving and thirsty. I brought her home - she has a microchip but I will not be returning her bc of obvious abuse (my vet called, no answer). I am stunned and horrified as to what this dog went through. I live in a very cold climate, the dog was in nearly zero temps for who knows how long. The microchip said her name is Zoe, we will be keeping her. She\u2019s been feasting and drinking water and snuggling. \n\nThis has been a wild surprise for 2025. Please send good vibes as we take her to the vet tomorrow to get checked. Her back legs are quite weak. ",

He didn't accept cookies at first, but eventually he built enough trust to do that, and even ate his whole bowl of dinner.\n\nI tried putting his leash on and getting him motivated to go for a walk or at least pee in the backyard, but then he got nervous and I stopped.\n\nWe tried just being near him and talking sweetly, and we've tried just leaving him alone here while we watch TV in another room.\n\nHe'll eat treats but won't attempt to follow them out of the crate. He's comfortable enough that we can pet him at least. He'll fall asleep on my hand. But I'm really hoping I can get him to pee and poop before going to bed tonight! Any suggestions? I feel kinda confident that once he's out of the crate he'll start feeling a lot better!",

Tatsumaku is laying across King's lap, being covered by Fubuki using King's jacket, whilst she herself is being covered by both King's shirt, which he has taken off to drape over her, and also his arms, embracing her in whatever protection he can provide.\n\nKing, who despite all the memes, is powerless. Who aside from his fearsome appearance is an otherwise ordinary human, who is in all other occasions a self admitted coward, is here giving his life to protect these two girls, futile though it may be. \n\nA lot is made of Mumen Rider, and rightly so, but aside from the memes about King, I don't think people often appreciate just how kind he is, he may not show it the way the way Mumen Rider does, but his heart is just as pure.
