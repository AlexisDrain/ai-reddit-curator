"selftext": "I don't know if you remember my post from a few weeks back about my sister wanting to name my niece Raefarty (pronounced Rafferty and not at all like Ray Farty).  My niece has been born! Two weeks earlier than expected, but she is healthy and home now.  When my sister first held her, she said, \"She's so adorable,\" and got an idea: She wanted to change from Theodora to Theodorable.  Thankfully my BIL put his foot down.  \n\nHe did give her carte blanche on the middle name.  When it was supposed to be Rafferty, they went with Rose to counterbalance Rafferty being different. Now that Theodora was the \"normal\" name, and because my sister just cannot *not* be extra, she chose Jaczynvil.  \n\nTheodora Jaczynvil. A Raefarty Rose by any other name would smell as sweet.\n\nWe are not from Florida.  BIL is not from Florida.  I don't think my sister's ever been to Florida, much less to Jacksonville.  I asked her how she came up with it and she said she always liked geographical names, which is news ...",

I\u2019m no professional but more of a jack of all trades. I learned so much during this build and had a few setbacks.\n\nBefore you comment about the chandelier light placement being offset from the fireplace. At the beginning of the build my wife wanted to have a fireplace and I said \u201cno\u201d. So that\u2019s why there is a fireplace in the build. Haha \n\nThe cubby under the fireplace has small birch logs in it now. \n\nMuch of the build is cut short as I can only use 20 photos. I hope you all like it! It\u2019s the first time I ever used shiplap from Home Depot. \n\nP.S. I said never again on the shiplap and as you might suspect, I have done more projects with shiplap and tongue &amp; groove board for future posts when I get all the photos together. \n\nI hope you all like it and if you have any questions I\u2019ll do my best to answer them in the comments.

I presumed he didn\u2019t like me so I was surprised when he got me a bday gift last month. \n\nAfter that we started hanging out more and actually became good friends. I like collecting rocks as a hobby (since childhood) and he is curious about it. A few times we would meet up and he even gave me rocks he thought I\u2019d like. It was very thoughtful and sweet\n\nMy friend (F) started asking me about him and always made shady comments. For example she would imply that I\u2019m not his type, that he\u2019s not interested in me etc. They were very snarky remarks but very low key and subtle. One time he said that my ey...",

And the guy gets off the next exit giving me the dumbestfuck grin and wave like we really made a connection there. Thankfully I got his description and license plate because guess what, he used washable marker and generously left the cap undone enough to wash away his number AND leak half a bottle of water all over my car. \n\n\nSo that might have been my absolute worst pickup attempt anyone else got one?",

Tell me, how many countries has china invaded the last century and how many the US has?\n\nSecond, with the trillions spent on us military if china would breach US airspace at this capacity it would cause major backlash and uprising for spending that much to have this much loss of intelligence\n\nThird and last, if you believe this lie, then whoever is propagating it has won on your ignorance.

She said she would pay me after one month of living here rent free. I was ok with that. \n\nOne night we hooked up and the sex was great. I joked about not needing to pay me after that. In reality, I don\u2019t need her money. She helps me in cooking And cleaning, and that\u2019s a lot off my plate. Now, we have this deal where she does sexual favors for me. I don\u2019t charge her rent. I think we both picked up on this exchange and kept things this way. \n\n",

"title": "The Underuse of Shang-chi in the MCU",
"selftext": "this movie was so much fun, it had amazing action and fight choreography, great humour, and great overall world building. This movie has so much sauce. a problem with the MCU is how poorly they are connecting the new characters with the wider mcu. It's been 3 years since we've seen Shang-chi in a live action project. And it will probably be another year and a half till we see him again. The post credit scenes of this movie set up him becoming an avenger and sadly we won't see that outcome of that until 2026, which is 4.5 years after the movies release. I do hope we see Simu Liu again as a lead in another marvel movie because he's great. Also his sequel is the perfect way to bring danny rand back into the MCU. Unfortunately we will probably have to wait untill 2027 for the next shang chi movie since Destin Daniel Cretton is directing Spiderman 4. On the bright side, the fight choreography in Spiderman 4 will be amazing",

Just before landing the crew announced that several people were trying to make close connections and to please remain seated if they were headed to Minneapolis or had a longer layover. \n\nI had 16 minutes from doors opening to doors closing. Almost everyone stayed seated and allowed people to move past them. I heard several people ask their neighbors if they needed to exit quickly. As I grabbed my bag one guy yelled an encouraging \u201cYou guys got this! Run!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not much, in the grand scheme of things. But I ran my ass off and made my flight with 3 minutes to spare. As someone who had to make my next flight for a business meeting, I do appreciate the group effort to help people get to where they\u2019re going. ",
