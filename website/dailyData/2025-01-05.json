Body didn\u2019t change except for more stretch marks and loose skin. Continued to feel bad about myself. Relationship with children\u2019s father ended. Became a full-custody single mom. Health issues started arising after a decade of being obese. I was in my mid-30s at this point. In 2020, a year after the split, the thought, \u201cFUCK, I can\u2019t die yet! My kids need me!\u201d crossed my brain. After a good chunk of trauma processing, something inside me said \u201cLet\u2019s fucking goooo \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc \u201c. And I lost 74 lbs in 9 months via intermittent fasting and keto. Health issues cleared up, which included Type 2 diabetes. And I also be feeling cute now or whatever. \n\nThe demons haven\u2019t left, but I\u2019m more equipped to handle the mfs. Now I\u2019m 40 and it doesn\u2019t feel like it at all. And Redditors DM me now. Which has been a life goal of mine. JK.  ",

His fear and panic was so evident and he immediately turned to the drugs hidden in his necklace to cope. They dulled his fear and allowed him to overlook the game\u2019s brutality and risk.\n\nI strongly believe that Thanos wasn\u2019t designed to be a stereotypical antagonist for S2. Instead, his character represents the horrible effects of substance abuse and how it can change a person.\n\nI just hate how people look at him so simply and only find him annoying and rude as his character has SO much meaning.\n\nHe was truely a broken shell of a man who was scared and resorted to drugs to numb himself, and having him in this show should open peoples eyes to the troubles of drug abuse. I believe that ignoring this completely oversimplifies his character and defeats his purpose. ",

"selftext": "...because we were literally on our way out the door for dinner with his grandparents. Also he already had all his cold weather gear on. If he wanted makeup he should have said so earlier. So we brought the makeup and brushes with us and he spent 45 minutes in their bathroom ruining my brushes and eyeshadows while everyone told him how pretty he looked. Except my dad who was being all \"you look like a girl\" and \" that is not for boys\" . Me and my mum told him not to be such an ass. Then my husband put on lipstick for dinner. My son is five and I want him to feel like there is no wrong way to be himself. ",

He glances down at me, and a warm smile of recognition appears on his face. He says hi, asks how I\u2019m doing, what am I up to these days - he\u2019s doing every social trick to try to get me to say something that will reveal who I am, he\u2019s clearly convinced that he knows me. I\u2019ve never met him before, never even been in the same room as him, but I do work in the media, so I answer his questions honestly. To be clear, I\u2019m very small-time, and have never worked on anything remotely as big as the sort of stuff he does, but the fact that I\u2019m talking about media jobs convinces him that he must know me through work somehow, and our friendship is cemented. \n\nWe keep chatting; he\u2019s so charming and affable, slippi...",

But our son recently had a minor surgery and of course insurance has been giving us the runaround even after pre-approving the procedure. (Thanks, United! Great job.) He's the primary insurance holder due to his job so I can only do so much. So I had to call him and ask *him* to call *them* even though I already did all the paperwork. (Being a grownup is so awesome btw.) Normally he told me to just use his signature and info because he can't be bothered, but I can't do a man's voice.

Right behind us you could hear the conversation of a man and a young girl. Typically I am just trying to get my 2 year old to not thrown things but she was being chill for whatever reason at this point and I could hear everything. The older (40s) and larger man asked the younger girl (window seat) if anyone she knew was sitting in the middle seat. She said no and he asked if he could sit there. When that happened my antennas went way up. What big guy wants to sit in a middle seat on a full plane?  \n\nShe said ok and they continued talking. Anyway, she mentions she is a sophomore in high school, extra curricular activities, etc. He continues to try really hard to relate which isn\u2019t easy nor should it be. At this point I go to the back and tell the flight attendants about what\u2019s going on.  Luckily, they ask the girl to move seats and that was that. \n\nMaybe I o...",
