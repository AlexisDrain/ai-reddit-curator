My pc doesn\u2019t have WiFi so I couldn\u2019t check that way. Checked all the drivers and everything appeared to be fine minus no internet. Dig a little deeper and found a little chip setting on top on my graphics card that said LanGaurd on it look on the motherboard board and the spot where it goes is burned. I\u2019m assuming the surge traveled through my Ethernet cable and this little thing saved the rest of the pc bc it all appears to be working except internet.

Just had to deal with the cop who showed up, who thankfully didn't seem to be a paint huffer like those idiots.  \n\nI hadn't seen the JW's in a while, and decided to fuck with them a little bit.  Just young kids getting abused and scammed by their cult, at my door with their bullshit, and I said \"In this house, we worship Satan.  Come in, I'll show you\".  Figured that strategy would work to get them to fuck off, and hopefully they spread the word within their hive.\n\nDidn't take very long for the cop to leave, but the two idiots were pretty upset and seemed to think I should get hauled off in cuffs from the looks of them at the sidewalk.",

He made some meows as he watched me, so I know he saw and I'm thinking he's learning this is normal. We got some thick, tall boots to protect our ankles just in case something spooks him into reacting aggressively again. One day at a time!",

It's a fucking spy camera designed as a clock.\n\n\nI rent my apartment, so I have suspicions it's my landlord, as he has a spare set of keys to every apartment in the building, and can just walk in with ease.\n\nAlthough it didnt record me naked, I feel so violated, like I feel paranoid even undressing in my own room\u2026 Sho...",

"selftext": "My brother killed himself back in April of last year, two weeks after our mom died. He left behind a Korean wife and ten year old son. She's been holding up well but is obviously scarred. I've known her for 20 years and we very much love each other. I lived with her and my brother a decade ago, and we became very close then. I helped take care of my nephew when he was an infant. \n\nMy brother was abusive towards her. One time he absolutely lost his mind and was threatening her, and I entered the room, asked her if she wanted me to stay or leave, and she just stared at me. I took that as meaning she wanted me to stay. He turned his anger towards me, and held me against a wall and punched me. I did nothing. He left for two days and I took care of my nephew while she ran their business. We became very close then, but she didn't cheat on him.\n\nI saw her for the first time in a decade over Christmas. She's staying here on a tourist's visa, and is trying to figure out how to immigrate here...",

To try and spare you any unnecessary details, what transpired was me having to fire one contract agency for grossly padding my resume, only for this new contract agency to end up bait-and-switching me.

Fuck Lex either way though. \nObviously. \nI am miffed he is gonna go to Moscow and interview Putin. But at the same time I can't help but wonder how dead behind the eyes, ghoulish, inhuman and disturbing Putin will be in comparison. He would hardly do better than he did with Tucker Carlson. \nSo...
