I was just trying to figure out why. Before that, I had spoken with some Palestinians who told me about the struggles in their country.

In the contract, it's laid out that my employer pays 100% of hotel and gas/airfare. \n\nNormally this is an extremely uneventful routine, it's a mid-sized Midwestern city with not much to do, it is what it is. A few months before I went back up we had our financial audit and one thing that was pointed out to our accounting department was a lack of controls on purchasing. The way it used to be was every manager/supervisor had a company credit card with a $1,500 balance and as long as we stayed under that limit, we didn't have to do any kind of purchase orders.\n\nAfter our audit, my accounting team decided to make purchase orders 100% of their focus.

Unlike the feral kitty, who took months to approach without her running away and is still extremely wild, Silver came up to me and let me pet her on day one.\n\nFast forward to yesterday, we have a ton of snow and I discovered Silver had an eye injury. I took her to the vet and decided to keep her inside for treatment. Was told she\u2019s probably an older lady, maybe 10 or in her early teens. She\u2019s got scarring on both eyes, Feline Herpes, and is a bit wheezy, but she is the sweetest cat I\u2019ve ever met. Unless you\u2019re a dog. My dogs are still learning about personal space, one swat at a time. I bet she was someone\u2019s pet at some point, but was lost or abandoned. No microchip sadly.\n\nToday, she curled next to me, purring like an engine while I gave her scritches. I\u2019ve never had a cat as a pet before. I might now.",
