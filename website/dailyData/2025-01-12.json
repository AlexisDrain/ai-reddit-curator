He\u2019s missing some teeth and other parts around there, but he eats just fine and with vigor! He drools all day, so I bought some small cotton bandanas to help keep the constant wetness off of his fur. He doesn\u2019t even mind wearing them .\nHe snuggles, purrs, chats, and loves the other pets in the house. He tolerates the kids. \ud83d\ude05\n\nWe have named him Toothless and he\u2019s getting a chip and neuter this week. Welcome to the family, sweet buddy. ",

It had lasted four months before the doctors decided I needed surgery and six months before I actually had the surgery. After surgery I was on crutches since I couldn\u2019t put any weight on that knee for a while. \nSo it was two weeks after my surgery and I was waiting for the bus after school, most of the people there were students from my school. I was sitting on the bench at the bus stop, when an women (late 40s to early 50s) came up to me, at first she just stood next to the bench staring at me, then she started loudly complaining about young healthy people taking up the seats. I still just ignored her since she wasn\u2019t talking to me, and I had my crutches next to me. When I still didn\u2019t get up she decided to talk directly to me.

"selftext": "Unfortunately we lost a dweller on the 8th at 1:50pm. My mother who was 61, was a fan of Fallout 76 and enjoyed playing with me and my wife. She absolutely loved Fasnacht Day as well as the marching anthem. She was always asking when it would be back. She loved to decorate our camps and adding her own pizazz to them. She loved to explore and find new treausure. She was even content in just watching us play. Unfortunately she never got to see the show as we couldn't afford a subscription. She got to enjoy the pets update before her health got worse. I put a vase with mom written on it at my camp. We are ps4 players. Tonight, let's all raise a Nuka Cola in her honor. If you would like to pay your respects in game, my gamertag is LordDoncic77. I built a homestead farm right next to the Charleston station. Please dm me on here if you would like to stop by.

So I looked up his email address and several sites listed his email. I emailed it a rather heartfelt letter and immediately got a response back that the email didn\u2019t exist. I was pretty shocked considering how many sites had this as his email. Then my 11 year old brain got to thinking. If the email didn\u2019t exist and all these sites had it listed as his email then I could create it. So I did. I answered his fan mail for about a year as a child. I\u2019ve always wanted to meet him specifically to tell him this story. Dan, if you\u2019re out there, sorry about that. I promise I was nice to people but I unfortunately did accept a few marriage proposals on your behalf.\n\nEdit: Inspired by this, I also impersonated Aaron Carter in an Aaron Carter teen chat room around the same time. I was an animal.\n\nEdit 2: I\u2019m going to bed but will leave this on and answer any remain...",

Who even knows. My guess is the shutdown will be just fine, its the startup on Sunday that will be the interesting part. \n\nAm I venting? Kinda. \n\nAm I commiserating? Kinda. \n\nAm I just telling this story starting before it starts happening? Yeah that mostly. \nMore I am just telling the story before it happens. \n\nShould be fun, and maybe flawless execution will happen tonight and tomorrow, and I can laugh at this ...",
