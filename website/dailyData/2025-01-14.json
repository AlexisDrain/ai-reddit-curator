"selftext": "My wife and I went on vacation and she asked my brother in law to stop by and feed the turtle while we were out. I guess he set the heat lamp she uses on top of the steam deck in it's case for some reason, and forgot to put it back. Anyhow the lamp was on a timer so for 4 days it boiled my deck for 12 hours straight.\n\nI pre-ordered this 512 gb LCD the day it was launched and used it extensively for several years. I haven't had too much time to use it lately, but it was a beloved part of my life. I guess I should just be glad I'm replacing a deck and not my entire apartment. Any chance Valve can fix this?\n\nI lost my job the day after Christmas for an unjustified reason, and while the vacation was already paid for, things have been stretched thin ever since and will continue to be for a while. Just keep getting kicked entering this 2025. Anyhow, thanks for listening to my rant, I needed a chance to vent, hopefully it isn't too much longer until steam deck 2 comes out.",

I booked her an Uber (from her phone) that night and the next day she turned up at an event I went to. She\u2019s literally following my every move and when I went to the local authorities they basically said they can\u2019t do much rn. \n\nI\u2019m going on a solo trip soon and she seriously fucking booked the same flight and dates as me. She even booked a hotel that\u2019s close to mine. (She knew about this trip before we fell out which is how she knows all the details). \n\nSo basically I\u2019m gonna have this deranged lunatic following me across the globe for god knows what reason.

She asked if I enjoyed the snow last week (we\u2019re in the south) and I told her yes, and that my son enjoyed it the most in our family. She asked about my other children and I told her I just had my son, there were no other kids. \n\nShe went on a rant that I was horrible and selfish for not giving him any siblings. She said he\u2019d grow up to be spoiled and awkward because he didn\u2019t have sibling interactions. I then told her that I had to have an emergency hysterectomy when he was born due to my uterus rupturing and didn\u2019t really have a choice on whether or not he would get siblings. She just stared at me a few seconds, then turned around and didn\u2019t say another word.",

The general mindset in my family is to live life in the moment. Everyone\u2019s pretty outgoing. My parents are part of Mardi Gras crews, my siblings all played sports. They\u2019re generally a fun bunch. But I never really fit in. \n\nAs I kid I liked to read, and I focused really hard on school. I hated going outside, and I especially hate the heat. I played chess, and was on the debate team. My family all kind of gave  me shit for all of this. They never really made an effort to do things I enjoy, but my parents loved to go to my siblings sports games. They wouldn\u2019t come to my debates. It was the same for all of my cousins, and other extended family. \n\nAs I got older I focused on my education and my career. I\u2019ve drifted apart from my family. They only call me when they want something at this point in my life. I\u2019m now happily ma...",

The cattle compacted the soil making it impossible for much to grow. With the cattle gone, the topsoil regenerates and the undergrowth and then the trees start to come back. With the trees come insects, birds and mammals.\n\nWe are almost tripping over these echidnas, they are so plentiful now. We are also getting red necked wallabies, lyre birds, wombats, roos, and an endangered species of bat. ",

"selftext": "I had a vasectomy in January of 2024. A few days after the procedure, my butt started itching uncomfortably and unceasingly.\n\nAt first, I thought it was a side-effect of the procedure. Maybe I was reacting to the bandages. Maybe it was the non-stop sitting as I recovered. Or, maybe I itched because I didn't shower for a few days post-op.\n\nBut, I recovered and got back into my normal routine and the itching continued.\n\nI tried everything (short of consulting my doctor; it's embarrassing to tell people your butt itches). I started showering twice daily. I outfitted all of my toilets with bidets. I even tried a few different types of creams and ointments. Nothing worked.\n\nI googled my symptoms and got a variety of results. Some sites suggested I might have hemorrhoids, pinworms, or some other butt-related ailment. One helpful forum simply said \"this happens when you turn 40. Your butt starts itching. You just have to deal with it.\" I resigned myself to having an itchy butt for the rest...",

She leaves and walks to the back, then comes to me out of his view and tells me what he had said to her.\n\nHe said \"You are so pretty\" blah blah blah, and she says \"Thanks, but I'm a minor\". He continues his advances and gets closer and says \"Well when do you turn 18?\". She was super uncomfortable with this and wanted to get the point across that she was underage and said \"not for a very long time\". He continues prodding at her, asking \"well what month?\", \"why won't you just tell me when?\", and then asks for her shoe size?? He said \"well tell me your shoe size so I can bring you a gift\" and is being super creepy and uncomfortable about it. She charges him out and walks away uncomfortably.\n\nGoing into protecti...",

"selftext": "This happened some years ago, but I still remember the situation very clearly.\n\nMy house has a garage next to it and a driveway to get out of my property and onto the street. The street in front of my house is rather narrow, two cars can't pass each other safely, and there are no sidewalks. Next to the street are walls (in that area people like to build small stone or concrete walls around their property - not really high (50cm?), but high enough to make it a barrier for cars and such). There are no official stopping restrictions, but due to the narrow street and the numerous driveways it's obvious that parking on the street is a really bad idea. Next to my property is a restaurant that gets stuff delivered every now and then. The kitchen entrance is next to our driveway, the delivery drivers usually park on the parking area across the street so they won't block traffic (the street is used by residents mainly, so there is not much traffic anyway).\n\nOn one particular day I had to lea...",

On the way back, we took Yulu bikes. But my Yulu only had 13-15 km range left, and my phone has this issue where it switches off at 30-40% battery.\n\nAround 10:30 PM, my phone switched off in the middle of the road, and I didn\u2019t know the way to go. At a red light, there was an uncle next to me on his scooter. I asked him for directions to HSR Layout. He was really friendly and told me the way. When I explained my problem, he took out a charging cable and tried to charge my phone from his scooter.\n\nThe signal turned green, so I moved to the side, and he came with me. He tried again, but it didn\u2019t work. Then he gave me his adapter and said, \u201cTake this beta and charge your phone somewhere. I\u2019ll collect it from your office tomorrow.\u201d\n\nI went to a small dosa shop and asked if I could charge my phone there. They were really n...",

"selftext": "From Jesse Michels\u2019s Twitter - Randy Anderson is a Green Beret and an American Hero. In March of 2014, he was taken to an underground facility at Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane in Indiana to a secure secret compartmentalized facility titled \u201cOff World Technology\u201d. He was shown an orb levitating above a podium and a \"gauntlet\" emitting holographic, hieroglyphic-looking text. This second object reportedly killed the person retrieving it. I have back-channeled with Navy contacts who say that while Wright Patterson reverse engineers the Air Force\u2019s most exotic retrieved technology, Crane does this for the Navy.\n\nRandy also STILL occasionally works contract jobs at Area51 and has seen \u201celectrogravitic\u201d antigravity triangle-shaped craft flying around the test site.\n\nRandy\u2019s credentials are beyond reproach: we have his DD214 as evidence of his service and his weapons training certificate from Crane proving he was stationed there. The implications of this interview cannot be overstated....",
