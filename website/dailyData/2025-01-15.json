The tattoo artist complained to my sister and said \u201cshe knows it\u2019s not going to be perfect, right?\u201d Which I think is very unprofessional to talk about your client behind their back. She thought I was asking too much and nitpicking the tattoo, but the wings being different shapes and the line in the cup are major flaws. I could maybe see the one nail as being a little nitpicky, but that\u2019s all I asked for other than 2 major issues.

That is plainly unacceptable and warrants adequate compensation no matter what.\n\nWhether or not you think people lost some jades in the two MOC cycle and PF cycle that started during 2.7 is irrelevant as it's simply a matter of false advertisement.

There was also a big effort to ignore my grief and to expect me to move on like nothing happened. The only time this was ever truly mentioned was when I was 13 and he sat me down and asked me to ask his wife if she'd adopt me. He told me she wanted to adopt me but didn't want me to get angry at her for asking because I still had a photo of my mom in my bedroom and I talked about her still. During that little talk he made a point of saying his wife had raised me far longer and had done everything a real mother should, so it was time for me to acknowledge her in that role and position in my life and make it official.

It\u2019s actually pretty interesting though, and I wanted to genuinely know why this guy gets the amount of hate he does. I\u2019ve even seen multiple people go as far as saying he was their MOST hated character, or/and they hated him more than objective bad people and sometimes even murderers like thanos, player 124, the frontman, etc. Another common discourse is that he should \u201cman up\u201d, as he is a grown man of 27 years old. Despite that not being a point that is relayed about any other character. Even in the scene where most of his hate stems from (where he watches player 380 be killed instead of helping), this scene somehow causes people to be angrier at him than they are at the actual killer himself!

I laughed because I knew Faker had won two more world championships since then, which he literally refused to believe. He later converted to a religion with Faker as God, the player he previously despised (he was an LPL fan), claiming that now more than ever there would never be a \"next Faker.\"\n\nI actually thought a lot about it\u2014if there was no one close or no one that could come close to the metrics set by Faker. To my surprise, the answer was hiding in plain sight all this time.

"selftext": "I left work this afternoon keen as to get home and I\u2019m heading south on the gateway aerterial in my little white mazda to go south over gateway bridge, chocka block like usual at peak hour. My tyre hit something hard on the road and as I was peaking the top of the bridge I could hear a loud flap flap flap. Then it got louder and I realised it was a blown tyre. Chucked on the hazards, did the crawl of shame over the bridge and pulled in left at the bottom. Got the spare tyre and tool bits out and realised I\u2019m stuffed. I have no bloody idea. Next minute, a big strong fella called Brad pulled over in his truck, whipped out his electric tool and got that spare tyre on in 2 min. He even explained to me where the jack needs to be placed to be safe and that my spare should only do up to 80 clicks. \nBrad, if you\u2019re out there, thank you so much for taking the time out of your day to help a girl that really needed it. You were my hero today. ",

One night my other half saw him sitting on the porch and opened the door to greet him, he walked right in and we wiped him down. He purred the entire time, then went over to a cat tree and went to sleep. We took him to the vet the next day, he had no chip, and our vet told us he was a senior. He has become an inside kitty, and has taken to sleeping in all the soft spots, often ending up next to one of the feral mamas we\u2019ve taken in. ",

Mom is vaguely listening from the kitchen, but is not active in the conversation when this goes down.\n\nDad: While I understand why you guys came out and all, we're happy with our church. But we'll talk it over and see.\n\nMissionary: You're the man of the house; you should be telling your wife what the situation is.\n\nMom: &lt;stomps angrily from the kitchen&gt; I will *not* be spoken about that way in my own house. You can leave NOW. &lt;Opens and gestures emphatically out the door&gt;\n\nThe problem - remember how she'd been washing dishes?

The last time they were close enough for nicknames (appropriate or not) they got into a fistfight in the hall while working on an assignment together. They have also been informed that coochie is a synonym for vagina and we don\u2019t care if it\u2019s in their mom\u2019s favorite 90s country song or what you say when tickling a baby. \n\nThanks for putting up with my increasingly weird emails \n\n\nlol what the fuck am i doing with my life? \n\nEdit: I didn\u2019t send the last line of what the fuck am  I doing with my life.
