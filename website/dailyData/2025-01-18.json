We have lived together for two months.\n\nA few hours ago, Casey approached me saying that she wanted to talk about something \"serious.\" At first, I didn\u2019t know what to expect, but she wanted to share something traumatic that had happened to her before we met, and she asked if I would be willing to listen. I of course said yes, I would, if she\u2019d be willing to share.\n\nCasey hesitated for a second, like she wasn\u2019t sure about telling me, but then gave me the full story. What happened was when she was a university student, she had a crush on a pizza guy. He worked at a small shop near her apartment, and he would often deliver to her. She wanted to ask him out, but she wasn\u2019t sure how, so she consulted her friends.\n\nHer friend group talked over it, and then one brought up the suggestion of answering the door in lingerie. The others jumped onto the idea quickly, and while Casey had doubts, they quic...",

He drove us up the wall. I spent his entire time with us making bets on who would be first to cram him into a locker.\n\nOne thing he hated was how other people would go to deal with things, leaving the \"command center\" (the office) instead of \"commanding.\" One day he walked into the office and the receptionist was in the restroom, the principal was in a meeting, and the office manager had gone to look at something. I, the registrar, was working head down at my desk.\n\nThat man walked into the middle of the room and announced on the radio (to 15 people, criticizing all of them including the principal in her meeting) \"This office is completely empty! What if a parent walked in?\"\n\nHe was five feet from me. I picked up my radio and said to him and 15 other people, \"Dr. \\_\\_\\_, I'm right here. Hi! Your glasses are ...",

"selftext": "I just got it from eBay and I have mixed feeling .First of all charging my ps3 controllers without it being on is a bless alone .Also having my controllers so well protected is also a bless adding to that the ms and sd card reader is also cool to have since I was always jealous of the backwards model readers .Last but not least it has a usb hub in the back witch also helps me plug all the other controller charges that I have \u2026.and an on off switch . That\u2019s it .\n\nWhat do you think about this kind of accesorie?",
