Problem solved.\n\nOr so I thought.\n\nLast night, I woke up to the sound of something rattling. I squint into the dark, and there\u2019s Whiskers. He\u2019s sitting next to the cup holder, pawing at the water glass like it\u2019s a puzzle. After a few moments of intense concentration, the little menace used his teeth to lift the entire glass out of the holder and proceeded to dump it on the floor, all while maintaining eye contact.\n\nI\u2019m now wondering if I should hand over my degree, build him a tiny diploma, and rename him Professor Whiskers.\n\nTL;DR: I tried to out-engineer my cat.

We had already been encouraging Bluesky as a source over other platforms, since by not forcing users to log in it is more accessible and it does not suffer from the various other issues affecting Twitter. Our main concern with a full ban is that while many F1 journalists have joined Bluesky, teams, drivers &amp; FOM have not. But we also realize that it\u2019s a *chicken or the egg problem* and as a community of almost 5 million, we probably have a non-trivial effect as to what platform is the native source for F1 news\n\nIn the end we\u2019ve settled on the following approach:\n\n* For a trial period we will ban all content from Twitter with the only exceptio...",

"selftext": "r/Boston,\n\nLet us take decisive and responsible action\u2014ban links to Twitter, or whatever they are calling it now.\n\nTwitter has devolved into the realm of nonsense, conspiracy theories, and attention-seeking outrage. It is where reasonable discourse goes to die. The man running the show is, at best, a fool with too much money and, at worst, a vocal supporter of ideas that have no place in decent society. Either way, it\u2019s a mess, and we shouldn\u2019t be giving it any more attention than it deserves.\n\nThink it over if you must, but the answer is clear: it is time to take out the trash.\n\n  \n  Edited to add: I appreciate the moderation team for handling things swiftly and effectively. Well done.",

Vor allem aufgrund der kontroversen Entwicklungen unter der Leitung von Elon Musk m\u00f6chten wir verhindern, dass Traffic zu dieser Plattform beitr\u00e4gt.\n\nWir sehen diese Regel\u00e4nderung als logische Erweiterung unserer bisherigen Praxis, Social-Medi...",

"selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nToday there have been proposals among many subreddits to ban all links to www.twitter.com or www.x.com. After initially consulting among ourselves, the mod team here at /r/MadeMeSmile decided to open up this discussion to include the rest of you, as well. \n\nMost of the posts in /r/MadeMeSmile contain content that is hosted directly on reddit, and so our community would not be significantly affected by this one way or the other. Any comments that contain links to Twitter would be automatically removed; there's not many of these to begin with, so again, the impact would be small. But it would make the mods smile....\n\nPlease let us know what you think by limiting the discussion to this post only. The mods will be listening closely over the next few days. Please remember to follow our rules, especially Rule 1. Don't be a ~~dick~~ jerk.",

"selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nAs I'm sure many of you have seen today, plenty of subs (with user support) have decided to move away from X as an allowed submission link in their communities. The mod team has been reached out to in modmail and there have been a few threads asking for the change, so we wanted to more formally reach out soliciting feedback.\n\nObviously some recent developments expedited the switch, but over the past few months a number of big subs (for example, r/formula1) were already starting to move away from that platform for usability reasons. Without an account direct links to X won't let you view replies/context for tweets and may not let you view the content at all; switching to screenshots and websites that don't require accounts would improve subreddit usability. That said, making the change would have some growing pains (community managers and content creators are still predominantly on X) but if this is something that has support then we'd do our best to enforce it.\n\nPossi...",

"selftext": "Given Musk\u2019s actions on Monday, it may be time to rethink how we engage with the platform. Beyond Musk giving two Nazi salutes, he has repeatedly amplified harmful rhetoric and interacted with accounts promoting Nazi ideology, raising serious questions about Twitter\u2019s role in spreading hate and extremism. Continuing to share links to Twitter content risks contributing to the visibility of a platform that has become increasingly hostile to basic principles of decency and respect. Other subreddits are already considering policies to limit engagement with Twitter, and it may be worth joining this broader effort.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth remembering Musk\u2019s previous attacks on the D&amp;D community, which showcased his disregard for respectful discourse and his willingness to mock and alienate specific groups. As an alternative, we could encourage sharing screenshots of tweets rather than direct links. This approach would reduce engagement with the platform while still allowing users to discuss ...",

I'm sure you've seen other subreddits post about it but I want to go over the reasoning for why myself and the rest of the mods made this decision.\n\nThis is something that we've been contemplating for a little while now. X has become increasingly hateful, toxic and less and less moderated. This has, in turn, made us less comfortable with letting our subreddit link it to other people. Not to mention the distasteful things Elon Musk has done recently...\n\nSo in the interest of not stifling discussion and creating a better user experience, we are going to make image posts available(see the caveats) and allow content from X to be submitted as a screenshot as well as adding this to the exemption list on our original source rule. So if you find a web article that says exactly what the tweet does you're free to link that instead.\n\nAny questions or other suggestions? Leave them below. We're setting this post to ...",

In our initial consultation I told him that I was opting for extractions because I didn't think I could afford root canals and I felt like they were too far gone to be saved, he pointed out my wisdom teeth and we talked about a plan for all my teeth in general but ultimately I ended up expressing that I think I can only afford to work on the ones that are causing me pain for now. Well today at the appointment to extract my bad molars he asked if I would be okay with him extracting my wisdom teeth for free and it caught me so off guard that I thought I was misunderstanding him. I am not a religious person but I truly felt blessed by something today, I am so overwhelmed by someone showing so much compassion and empathy that its making me emotional",

Links to X will not be allowed as submissions or in comments - this includes mirror links.\n\n2. Content from X can only be posted as a screenshot, capturing the entirety of the tweet.\n\n3. **2.3 Check the \"new\" queue before posting** won't apply if the only other post is an X screenshot. When content is posted from an alternative source (such as a club statement, news article, or a journalist or club bluesky post), the X screenshot post will be locked, and a link to the new thread will be stickied to redirect conversation.\n\n4. Faked X screenshots will result in an immediate ban without a warning.",

I acknowledge that this action is largely just virtue signalling.\n\nBut if somebody starts popping off Nazi salutes at the presidential inauguration of a purported \"first world\" country, then virtue signalling is the least I can do.\n\nComments in this post will be moderated to a different standard than normal.

Stupid I know.\n\nHow did I get home? I Ubered.\n\nWhy was my cousin asking to leave at 11? She was drunk and probably had no idea what time it was.
