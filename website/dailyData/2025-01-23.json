You can discuss the change below, but please be civil. This post's replies will be restricted to members of the community due to influence from people outside of the subreddit.",

Hate speech and its promotion have never been acceptable in our community.\n\nIf you must share a tweet and cannot find an alternative source, please crop the tweet neatly (as shown in the example above) and share it as an image.

We also have banned InsideTheMagic and MiceChat. We will not allow screenshots from these sources as well. \n\nThank you everyone for supporting us over the years.\n\nFrom the r/Disneyland Mod Team\n\nEdit: We\u2019re banning Threads too!

After playing with ChatGPT's API, I realized that you can effectively dump raw job descriptions and ask it to give you formatted information back in JSON (ex salary, yoe, etc). I used this technique to scrape 1.6 million jobs (with over 325k remote jobs) and built powerful filters. I made it publicly available here in case your'e interested ([hiring.cafe](https://hiring.cafe/)).\n\nPro tips:\n\n* You can select multiple job titles and job functions (and even exclude them) under \"Job Filters\"\n* Filter out or restrict to particular industries and sectors (Company -&gt; Industry/Keywords)\n* Select IC vs Management roles, and for each option you can sel...",

Such as, twitter requiring a login to view, tweets frequently violating our subreddit rules, and reposts from twitter being low effort karma grabs.\n\nImportant information which originates on twitter, such as news from the official one piece account, is not \"banned\". However, you should not link to twitter in any way. Meaning, if you post a screenshot of news from twitter, make sure it's cropped. Even better, post it as plain text, instead of a screenshot.\n\nNon-critical posts from twitter, are banned in totality, including screenshots. This has pretty much been the case for about 5 years already.\n\nPlease remember that r/onepiece has a \"No Politics\" rule. So keep discussi...",

It\u2019s perfect for us\u2014romantic, outdoorsy, and has a killer wine selection (very important to us since we\u2019re wine enthusiasts). The wedding is in three months, and everything has been finalized.\n\nHere\u2019s the issue: My sister \u201cClaire\u201d (24F) got herself banned from the venue last year. She was at a party there and got into a massive argument with another guest. It escalated to her throwing a glass of wine at the guy and smashing a centerpiece. She was escorted out and told she wasn\u2019t welcome back. I don\u2019t know all the details because she downplays it, but the venue\u2019s management confirmed she\u2019s blacklisted.\n\nWhen Claire found out where our wedding was, she freaked out. She called me crying, saying it\u2019s humiliating that she won\u2019t be able to attend her own sister\u2019s wedding. She begged me to change the venue, but at this point, switching locations...",

I had a bunch of them, not the same one every day.  Some of the other teachers made fun of my \"uniform\" and there was some attempted bullying that I ignored.  When they'd ask why I always wore what I did, I'd just reply that I liked it.  They'd roll their eyes and I'd go back to whatever I was doing.  Near the end of what I knew would be my last year there, one of them started in again with \"WHY do you always wear the same thing?\"\n\nI stopped what I was doing and asked her if she really wanted to know.  She laughed and said she did, so I told her.  When I was a kid, one of my cousins was killed in a school shooting.  She bled out.  It was really hard for me and my family.  I ended up learning all I could about how to help someone who had been shot.  I always wore a cardigan to school so if one of the kids got shot, I'd have somethi...",

Simple as that.\n\nThat was the case until I bought my own home and he offered to paint it (he's a painter decorator).\nWhat a relief having a professional do the job and for the price of tea and biscuits...\n\n...except he's actually done a shit job.\n\nThere's fleks of paint everywhere. There's lumpy paint all over the wall. He's clearly not cleaned one brush properly and there's now faint streaks of a different colour mixed into the living room wall.\nHe insisted on painting a lot of it white, even though we weren't keen on that, and now I know why.\nWhite ceiling and white door trims/skirtings means he doesn't need to cut in.\n\nSo either he really half arsed it because we're not paying customers or he's shite at his job.",

There were some complications with hemorrhaging and brain swelling that required them to open a larger hole in the skull that they weren\u2019t able to completely cover due to the swelling. Things were touch and go overnight but today she\u2019s walking and eating. They\u2019re waiting to see if she can pee on her own. She seems not to have vision in her right eye and is exhibiting similar motor symptoms on her right side as she had during the worst of the tumour. We\u2019re waiting to see how much of that clears up. \n\nThank you so much everyone for your well wishes! At this time it seems like our little Sib may have some lasting disability but we don\u2019t know how much - and she should be able to have a happy life for several more years yet. She\u2019s only 6, so hopefully at least 10 more years!",

Our sub was no different and the thread had over a thousand comments. We have listened to your concerns on this topic, and so today we are removing all links to X/Twitter. If something is still important to share you may do so as a screenshot of the post with accompanying text describing the image.\n\nThe latest controversy was not the only factor in this decision. In recent years X/Twitter has become more hostile, less user friendly and less moderated. They have also [reinstated accounts involved with posting CSAM.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/07/27/twitter-csam-dom-lucre-elon-musk/) Obviously we cannot allow that to be posted here. \n\nAt the same time, users here rarely post links to X/Twitter, 6 times in the last year, and due to changes in how X/Twitter works, without an account you won'...",

I immediately tried it on this piece. You guys- game changer. It's not a big change, but I can absolutely see the improvement! The thinner outer outline on the right side and across the top has been whipped and I'm in love! (The thicker outer outline is stem stitch with 2 strands)\n\nI'm a newbie and learn something new from you amazing artists just about daily. I've whipped in a contrasting color but it never occurred to me to use the same color.  What a difference! Thanks friends! And now, back to whipping. Where was I..?",

While we definitely don't account for even a fraction of the traffic of the site, we're still going to do our part to turn people towards alternatives.  \n\nIf you would like to post a Tweet: Please take a screenshot of it and post it as an image. No source will be required for such posts.\n\nIf you'd like to post fanart where twitter is the primary source: please link the creator's alternative social media, such as bluesky or pixiv. Do NOT link their twitter. If they don't have alternative media, please do not post the fanart.  \n  \nMods will be in the comments to answer any edge cases, as well as to hear your opinions on the rule.
