"selftext": "I had just finished playing Arkham Knight. Batman faces his fears, his paranoia, and his hallucinations in the end and overcomes. I basically sobbed as I finished. Why? Because I have schizophrenia.\n\nIt's not even that bad, I'm high-functioning. I joke that it's just enough to ruin your life, but not enough to look disabled to others. But the unintended message hit home.\n\nI paid for a Cameo video from Mr. Conroy. In the introductory text I believe I simply explained how my name is pronounced, that I had schizophrenia and had been extremely moved and inspired to face my fears as Batman did in Arkham Knight. I ended with \"THANK YOU\".\n\nHis reply, this video, is my most prized possession. It's saved me from suicide countless times. Batman telling me he believes in me is extremely powerful... but over time, it's become Kevin believing in me that is equally powerful.\n\nI was not going to share this video until I found out about the comic he did where he discussed his schizophrenic brother....",

Pretty normal and straightforward. \n\nIf more than one person starts at the same time, then who gets the option to leave first is assigned on a rotating basis. So if you have the first option one week, you will be second the following, the third after that, then back to one. \n\nSo one afternoon, I was reporting to work with 2 other dealers, all set to start at the same time.

So she goes upstairs to shower, and her date shows up. I pull him aside and tell him everything. He was still very nice and ate dinner with me and Lisa. He also watched movies and made popcorn with Lisa. \nNow it\u2019s the next morning and Lisa is hopping mad. She yells at me about \u201chow dare you this and that!\u201d I\u2019m just standing there like \u201cthe fuck? She\u2019s mad cuz she didn\u2019t get no dick?\u201d Well she was indeed mad. Now she won\u2019t speak to me. Now I\u2019m feeling guilty. AITAH?\n\nPs I\u2019m high so this might not be typed out right like grammatical errors ",

"selftext": "True story, I was staying in Canada renting a room for way too much money in a house with like ten disgusting dudes living in every nook and cranny , the stench was horrendous with people that had horrific lack of hygiene. I had to block off the heater vent on the floor and keep the window open just to breathe . \n\nSo it got freezing cold and the house owner slum guy said we weren't allowed to have heaters in our room.\n\nOnly thing I own is an expensive laptop that has fancy video card and loud fan . I discovered that whenever I dropped all the torches around my house in Skyrim it really made my laptop video card run on full blast computing all those torches. This was about 300watts or something, of hot air coming out of my laptop fan and the power supply brick stuck in the feet of my sleeping bag . This is literally how I stayed warm and had fresh air..\n\nI was just thinking about how weird that was that Skyrim torches kept me warm. \n\nThanks for coming to my TED talk",
