Finally added Alaska today to complete the map. \n\nBecause each one is (on average) less than 10mm thick, this whole project actually didn't use that much filament (my best estimate is 3-4kg). \n\nThe scale of Hawaii is a little larger than it should be; the iteration of files I was using had the scaling a little off and I didn't notice until it was finished printing. Haven't decided if it's worth re-printing yet. \n\nDisclaimer: I am not the creator of the files used for this project. User @ansonl on Printables.com has posted all of them and optimized them for multi-color printing, which is something I have seen before. ",

My school and my peers are very tolerant and welcoming, and before Tuesday, I was fairly sure that we did not have any outspoken racists or nazis. We have lots of students of different political orientations, but for the most part everyone accepts each other. However, one day after Elon's nazi salute (yes, it was a nazi salute,) I personally observed 6 salutes in one day. 6. (Later I learned that 2 of the boys who did them were only reacting to what happened, not embracing it. But the other 4... they were embracing it.) One of them even did it directed at me. It is so fucking disgusting how we have let things like this become more acceptable in society and government. I'm just waiting for one of those idiots to slip and say the K-word or N-word or something, then I'd have an excuse to punch them.\n\nEdit:   these were dispersed incidents.

I love her and since we're both financially stable we're thinking of starting a family together. \n\nMy ex girlfriend Amy is in jail. She worked in finance, pretty high up, already earning great money but got involved in an illegal scheme to make ''easy money''. Everyone involved has been jailed. I heard about this and thought it was a shame, but we haven't been together for four years so I had no reason to reach out to her. That was until I received a letter from her in the post, where she told me that all her family and friends had cut her off, and asking if I could be in contact with her purely as a friend, so s...",

At first I didn't want to but I gave her the 2nd largest room for her office and the largest became our bedroom. I took a significantly smaller room for my office. She occupied the 2nd living room for herself.\n\nWe slept together in the bedroom, as would any other couple for the first few months. We had arguments here and there but nothing major. After about 3 months, we had a big fight about decisions involving the house. Pest control, upgrades, modifications, etc. She said since it's my house, she will not be bearing any of the financial burden that would come of disposing of the pests and any issues that would come up with the modifications.

No one was successful, but I bought food and left it out. I let the hotel know, but nothing came of it. \n\nThe next night, the poor guy was screaming again. I bought more food, and spent an hour standing frozen over the food until I could snag this little one. \n\nThe original plan was to get him to a shelter. I got him checked out by a vet, and was warned that no one would take him. Shelters were full, and since he was a black cat it would be even harder. When we went to PetSmart we saw every single cat there was a void looking for a home. My husband said he was ours now. \n\nWe originally named him after the hotel, but as you can see with his half a tail, he is clearly a Bobcat. We spent the next two weeks in Hawaii doing tourist things, and since we couldn\u2019t leave him in the hotel, Bob joined us. We climbed a mountain with thi...",

I did not want to risk seeing him, dealing with him, or getting more traumatized by the situation. So i called a cop. She came to the scene (was one i talked to earlier this week) and i love her. She told me to place all his belongings in the grass. I did as told with my friend. She then told me and him to leave so not only does he have to make a million trips down stairs solo for his stuff. But if he wants to throw it away he has to walk like 6 blocks to the dumpster. So my inconvience turned into a officer controlled inconvience! And i maintained zero contact! ",

Long story short - after a week she succeeded, she went unclaimed, I made her mine, she had some health issues and issues with people... After lots of love, patience, and vet care, she is now the most snuggly kitty ever.  She does not do well inside, so she remained a barn cat.  She seemed lonely when she wasn't getting attention from me or her dog friend, so I started searching for a cat friend for her.\n\nI checked local ads, groups, and barn cat programs for over two months.  I was waiting until I found the cat that \"felt right.\" I eventually found the cat that my heart wanted.  At first glance, I thought this cat was a burn victim - the fur around his eyes was missing, he had half an ear, a couple crispy-looking whiskers, and he was PISSED.\n\nI adopted him from a local humane society (barn cat program) a little over two weeks ago.  Thankfully, I found out he wasn't bur...",
