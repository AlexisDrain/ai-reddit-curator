"selftext": "I got to the store today with my son and saw an open space. Sweet, a pull through! I go to pull in and see that some dumbass took up 4 parking spaces and wasn't visible from the laneway. I had to back out of the space since I couldn't fit and ended up parking next to him. I shook my head and grumbled about it and went in to do my shopping.\n\nWhen I got back to my car, I noticed that two other people had piled their carts around this idiot's car. One in front and one in the back. I've literally never once in my life left my cart in the parking lot since I'm not an animal but it only took a few seconds for me to know what I had to do. I put my cart next to the driver side door of this guy's car and it felt great. Hopefully more people kept up the pay it forward cart pile after me!\n\nScrew you, people who take 4 parking spaces.\n\n\n\n",

I'd give him loving, and food, and water. He'd come up to me and nuzzle me, looking for pets, and he'd bring his stray buddies for treats and fun. But one day, I was out walking in the neighborhood before a snowstorm was gonna hit our area, and noticed animal control sweeping through our little under construction neighborhood. I just... had a feeling.\n\nSomething told me they got my boi.\n\nSkip forward about 10 days, and sure enough he appears on the pound's website. I knew it was him too, the look in his eyes, the mottling on his nose, that big, blocky head. Yep. It was him.\n\nOne of our dogs just died a few days ago, and now the house is a little empty.

Reed Sheppard is averaging double the amount of minutes, so maybe you can argue that Reed is worse. \n\nI tried going back 48 years in basketball reference and I could not definitively find a worse non-injured top 3 draft pick rookie than Sheppard. \n\nReed Sheppard is on pace for a historically awful rookie year for a top 3 pick, arguably the worst",

A local company installed the cabinets and butcher block counter and then we did the tile backsplash.

"selftext": "A few years ago, my manager decided to crack down on \"workplace discipline.\" His first rule? Everyone had to work their exact scheduled hours\u2014no more, no less. If your shift was 9:00 to 5:00, you couldn\u2019t start a minute early or leave a minute late.\n\nNow, I\u2019m the kind of person who likes to finish what I\u2019m working on, even if it means staying a little past my shift. But fine, rules are rules.\n\nAt 5:00 sharp, I started dropping everything. Middle of a call with a client? \u201cSorry, it\u2019s 5:00. Let\u2019s pick this up tomorrow.\u201d Writing an email? Draft saved, computer shut down. My coworkers followed suit. Soon, the office was a ghost town at exactly 5:01 every day.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for chaos to erupt. Deadlines got missed, calls were dropped, and clients weren\u2019t happy. Management started to notice. After about two weeks, the rule magically disappeared, and we were told, \u201cJust do what you need to get the job done.\u201d\n\nFunny how quickly things change when you follow orders *too perfectly.* \ud83d\ude0f\n...",

Don't let this deter you from getting comfortable though. If you forget what number you are on, just pick any number you remember counting and go from there don't give it too much thought. \n\nDon't try and picture anything (no sheep's etc.) Just slowly count and watch the back of your eyelids. \n\nAt some point (for me, typically between 60 and 100) you may find your mind goes off on a tangent and you forget to count. This is normal. Let it happen and when you remember,...",

For context I\u2019m an 18yr old 5\u20193 female, so being at 155lbs really impacted my health. \n\nI\u2019ve been doing consistent fasting of 18-20hrs, eating once a day. Staying active is incredibly important for me, I attempt to get in at least a 30 minute walk. Another game changer was counting calories, somewhat controversial, but it helped me realize where the weight was coming from. ",

He could walk 10min max and they told us he may have one or two years left, as he had to take strong meds daily. We worked hard to get him to healthy weight and after a year we were even able to take piper hikes in the mountains. Over the years, his age started to show though, so we decided to get him a brother, which boosted his spirit \u263a\ufe0f\n\nToday we celebrate his 14th birthday, a day I hoped to see, but never really thought possible!\n\nI hope you enjoy some of the pics I took over the years and celebrate with us.

My parents always have tums on hand, and my best friend often complains of it, so I assumed that it was something that happened with age.\n\nI went to the store and bought some antacid chews and pills, and was sure to keep them on hand. If I had something I knew could trigger it, like chinese food, I would be sure to take some before I went to bed.\n\nAt first, the chews seemed to help. If I woke up with heartburn, I would take some and sit in an upright position until the pain went away.

"selftext": "Pretty much what the title says, I was a sous chef at Tao Chicago this past year, and we did a bunch of huge buyout events. When I saw the receipts from the events I was super upset, because the staff are splitting the smallest portion of the revenue. Some of these events we worked with 3 cooks and 3 runners so the 5k in labor is not even close to what was actually spent. I pointed this out, and said that we could easily pay the staff more. I was told that my services were no longer required.",
