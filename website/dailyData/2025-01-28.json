I have two kids in braces and one of them is in counseling twice a month.  I was hoping they would still let us work partial days off but they aren't.   I'm going to have to take a full day off every time one of them has an appointment.   I don't know how I'm going to do this.  I'm also in the process of getting divorced and I can't even get their dad to do the dishes so he's not going to help just to punish me.",

When I stepped into the kitchen and offered the cake to his mother as a thank you for inviting me, she took the plate over to the garbage bin, dumped it in, and handed me the plate back.  When I told my husband what she did, he confronted her and all of a sudden the crocodile tears started and she claimed she grabbed the plate but didn't get a good grip, I let go to quickly, and it fell to the floor, so of course it had to be thrown away.  My SIL \"confirmed\" that was what happened.\n\nMy STBX owned his own business and they called me a gold-digger behind his back.  Of course they insisted on a pre-nup, which I didn't c...",

It was Nvidia\u2019s worst day on the market since March 16, 2020, which was early in the Covid pandemic. After surpassing Apple last week to become the most valuable publicly traded company, Nvidia\u2019s drop on Monday led a 3.1% slide in the tech-heavy Nasdaq.\n\nThe selloff was sparked by concerns that Chinese artificial intelligence lab DeepSeek is presenting increased competition in the global AI battle. Late last month, DeepSeek unveiled a free, open-source large language model that it says took only two months and less than $6 million to build, using reduced-capability chips from Nvidia, called H800s. \n\nNvidia\u2019s graphics processing units (GPUs) dominate the market for AI data center chips in the U.S., with tech giants like Alphabet, Meta, and Amazon spending billions of dollars on the processors to tr...",

"title": "YSK: The LDS church is threatening to sue cities that try to enforce their zoning laws",
"selftext": "The LDS church has announced many new temples. While communities would generally welcome a temple, the church insists on building them on a grand scale and in areas where they don\u2019t fit in. Instead of working with communities to build something that fits in with the community and complies with local zoning laws, the church has a pattern of threatened litigation when it doesn\u2019t get its way, as many communities have experienced recently.\n\nHere is an article about the church threatening to sue a town in Texas. https://www.dallasnews.com/news/faith/2025/01/27/church-of-jesus-christ-of-latter-day-saints-to-sue-fairview-over-temple-dispute/?outputType=amp\n\nMembers of the church are generally good people, so this post is not about the people or their beliefs. It\u2019s about the way the church interacts with communities when it doesn\u2019t get 100% of what it wants. \n\nWhy YSK: The church has announced many of new temples in the past few years, and one might be coming to your community.

"selftext": "Irish farmer Miche\u00e1l Boyle was digging a drain in a bog on his property when he noticed something that \"didn't look natural\" in the peat. When he pulled it out, he caught the scent of butter \u2014 and that's exactly what it was. As early as the Iron Age, ancient populations in Ireland used peat bogs, which were cold and low in oxygen, to preserve butter and animal fat. When Boyle called experts about his discovery, they confirmed that he had indeed found a 50-pound chunk of \"bog butter.\" They found a small piece of wood within the slab, suggesting that it was once stored in a box that had since decomposed. One archaeologist actually tasted this centuries-old discovery, noting that it was similar to plain old unsalted butter even after all these years.",

I just said it is a game and nobody owns the gyms, and he just kept saying \"its MY gym its next to MY house\".\n\nI didn't realise people took this game so seriously. ",

Was a god damn good game and I\u2019m glad we made some of you nervous at least for a little bit. I\u2019m not here to blame anyone on our loss, we just came up short. \n\nI really wanted to say how awesome of an experience I had in my short time here. The fans, the stadium, the experience of the entire game day was beyond what I imagined. You guys throw a hell of a party. Very similar vibes to Buffalo. Everyone I talked to was respectful and made good conversation. A lot of respect for our team, and I appreciate that. If you\u2019ve never been, I invite you to come and check us out. Come to my tailgate and let me feed you! \n\nI hope to visit again, just would prefer it to be a regular season matchup. Please just let us win on...",

I actually don't mind the writing (and just so happened to have an appropriate sticker response), but my car has been keyed/scratched significantly since then and the recent off-road event was scary as fuck for my 2 small kids. \n\nMy spouse wants me to remove the stickers. If I was a single person, it wouldn't bother me but their safety comes first. Ironically, we moved because I didn't want my kids to suffer recriminations for my politics and activism.\n\nIt's obvious I've triggered some locals; my spouse thinks it's church one, but maybe it was the gay frogs?
