I\u2019m using my fingers like a pilgrim and I\u2019m having a hard time so after a few minutes I decided to lay down in the tub and use the shower head. I turned the setting to partial jet \u2014 so I didn\u2019t spray my vag off \u2014 and got busy.  I\u2019ve had a low libido lately so I was still having a hard time with completing my mission. I changed the setting from partial to full jet. \n\nThis is where fuck up #1 happens. This is a new shower head so I wasn\u2019t familiar with how powerful the spray is.

"selftext": "My sister (32F) has been married to her husband (35M) for six years. We\u2019ve always been close, but recently she confided in me that she's been having an affair with her coworker. She claimed her marriage had been \"on the rocks\" and begged me not to tell anyone.\n\nFast forward to last weekend: her husband showed up at my place out of nowhere, visibly upset. He told me he found some \"suspicious\" texts and asked if I knew anything. I panicked and said, \"You should probably talk to her.\" That must have been a dead giveaway because he stormed off, and now my sister is furious. She says I basically confirmed the affair by being cagey and that I \"ruined her life.\"\n\nI told her I wasn't going to lie for her and that this mess was her responsibility. My parents think I should've done more to protect her, but I feel like she put me in an impossible situation. AITA?",

Of which $1,100 was paid, meaning should be ~$700 return based off income brackets. \n\nReviewed the details, and the tax rate was **114.80%** which said was calculated by their AI program.

That's how I got my ultimates and 99% of my skins.\n\nThe thing is, when they promised fkin wonderland with the 2025 changes, and they told us that actually we would be getting MORE skins than BEFORE, principally on the premium pass, I believed it, even after everyone here saying that no, it would be WORSE than before, I told myself \"no, I'll buy it this time to feel if it's worth it or no\". Guess what, it's not.\n\nI'm not ashamed for investing in those passes these last (two?) years. It's my money and I really enjoy league, but this experience was really frustrating. The pass skins are simply horrible, not even the Katarina one is worth it. There are almost no orbs...",

If you have guns in your home, someone familiar with gun law.  Some lawyers will allow you to put down a very small retainer fee.\n\nIf you are taken away you will know who to call, or your family will have someone to call right away and they will not have to search for a lawyer \n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/29/trump-presidency-news/\n",
