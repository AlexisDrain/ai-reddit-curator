"selftext": "With everything going on in America right now, I think every American woman should read the Handmaid\u2019s tale by Margaret Atwood. I listened to the audiobook version while I was at work. The similarities between the book and real life right now is striking. Everything in the book has happened at some point in human history. \n\nA few days ago in the US, a New York doctor was arrested for prescribing the abortion pill to a pregnant teenager. In the Handmaid\u2019s Tale, doctors who provided abortion services to women were executed. Politicians are trying to pass legislation that would give doctors the death sentence for performing abortions. \n\nI could go on about all of the similarities between the book and the current administration. I think the book foreshadows what will happen if we keep electing Christian extremists. They don\u2019t see women as people. They see us as breeding stock. The elite like Elon Musk want us to have as many babies as possible so the elite will have factory workers. \n\n",

"title": "LPT: When Someone Raises Their Voice, Lower Yours. It\u2019s a Psychological Power Move.",
"selftext": "Ever been in a heated argument or faced someone who was unnecessarily aggressive? Instead of matching their energy, do the opposite &amp; lower your voice.\n\nPeople expect anger to be met with anger &amp; when you respond calmly, it disrupts their emotional momentum.\n\nIt forces them to mirror your calmness, de-escalating the situation naturally.\n\nIt signals confidence &amp; the most composed person in a conversation holds the most power.\n\nReal-life example: A guy at the airport was yelling at the gate agent over a delay. Everyone around was tense. I simply said, \u201cHey, man, I get it, but yelling won\u2019t fix it. What do you actually need right now?\u201d His whole attitude changed. He sighed, nodded, and started talking normally.\n",

But apparently that was wrong to ask. I also added the phone translation to my wife\u2019s audio message. I know they don\u2019t translate the best so I can explain if needed. ",

She said \u201cif I\u2019m not up to it, I\u2019ll help you out at least.\u201d I said that her timing was great because seeing her in her swimsuit at the gym gave me a huge urge to go down on her, if she\u2019s up for that. She gave me a smile and raised her eyebrows, but then\u2026\n\n\u2026she realized our teen daughter was standing behind me. She had heard it all - she was in the garage and we didn\u2019t realize it. \n\nI pretended (or hoped) she hadn\u2019t heard anything, but my wife says she clearly did. \n\nI don\u2019t know if we should talk to our daughter about what she heard, or just leave it alone. Ugh. \n\n",

"selftext": "Everyone\u2019s obsessed with AI stealing jobs, but I\u2019m more concerned about something way worse\u2014what if we forget how to think?\n\nLook at what happens when people rely too much on autocorrect\u2014now apply that to medicine, law, engineering, and finance. If AI gets so good that we stop training humans in these fields, we\u2019re basically outsourcing intelligence itself.\n\nIt won\u2019t be some sci-fi robot takeover. It\u2019ll be us getting lazy because, hey, why struggle when the machine gives you the answer? But what happens when it fails, and we realize no one remembers how to fix anything?\n\nWe worry about AI replacing us, but the real nightmare is AI making us obsolete\u2014not because it\u2019s smarter, but because we got dumber.",

I was surprised to find someone who played Game Boy like me. I became friends with her. We played Pok\u00e9mon and Dr.Mario together. My friend said she\u2019s like Kirby's Dreamland, while I like Megaman World and The Legend of Zelda.\n\nShe even came to my house to play Game Boy. We had so much fun together. Whenever she's won a game, she would be really happy and tell me about it. I was happy for her too. We enjoyed our time together a lot until one day, she passed away from cancer. She was always my best friend.\n\nWhen she died, I couldn't express how I felt. I didn't know what to say or how to feel. All I could do was cry. I still miss her a lot\u2026 we\u2019re became bestfriend just because of the Game Boy\u2026 \ud83d\ude22",
