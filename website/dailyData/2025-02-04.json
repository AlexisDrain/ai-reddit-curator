When I confronted her, she admitted to it but swore it only started last year. I wanted to believe her, but something inside me wouldn\u2019t let it go.

She briefly lived with my dad after I came along, but we all moved back in with grandma and grandpa very shortly after they had divorced. This happened again with my little sister\u2019s father and when my grandpa passed away, my mother took care of my grandma in exchange for a place to continuously stay without having to pay rent. After my grandma passed, she was not able to get back on her feet for another decade, staying with an old friend who needed care as well; but he eventually began to mistreat her. Just recently, I was able to help her move from Florida to Tennessee, closer to my husband and I, where she could transfer with the job she had successfully kept for two years and also received a promotion prior to the move.

I\u2019d have so much garbage being accumulated that I wouldn\u2019t be halfway done with my section by lunch and had no time to get the medical waste taken out. I complained multiple times to management who were also getting heat for the piling up of waste.

He is a straight man who doesn't enjoy sex. We don't kiss or have sex, but we are very physically affectionate and are always cuddling and holding hands. \n\nI know people will think we're just close friends, but we are more than that. He is my soulmate. There is absolutely nobody on this earth I would rather spend my life with, and he feels the same. Neither of us feel like we're missing out on anything. We love each other so deeply. \n\nI don't expect anyone to understand, but we are really happy together. ",
