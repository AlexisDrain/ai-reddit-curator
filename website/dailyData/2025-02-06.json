I did have to cave and wear makeup (that\u2019s the only way i\u2019ll leave the house) because my uncle passed away. since the medicine, there has been no new spots or burning anymore! i take keflex in the morning, after noon, and night time. i take the prednisone together in the morning. i completely cut out pop and candy (my addictions) and use cerave face wash and moisturizer along with tower 28 spray. this is not the pace i wanted it to heal at but thank God it is healing. I personally don\u2019t see improvements but im very hard on myself BUT my family &amp; friends do. I will update in a couple days. Thanks for following \u2764\ufe0f (also if you have any advice to help it heal faster please let me know, without food dieting because i\u2019m not doing that). With all love\u2764\ufe0f\n\n\n- FIRST PICTURE TODAY \n-SECOND PICT...",

I gave him a trim before we left, then we wrapped him in plastic (including the barrel - good call!) and moved him in a moving truck. We lost one branch in the detangle upon unwrapping and one when I had to lay his sizable butt down to repot him. BUT he's still over 5ft and now he's BLOOMING! Something he never did in our last home. He's sprouted new branches and he has a multitude of bee visitors. Thanks all for the advice and support from Wilber and myself!",

I would've voted for W and McCain over Obama, and while I respect much of the Democratic Party's ideals, I find them too radical for my taste. However, I haven't been able to really call myself a Republican since Trump took over the Party. What was once a Party of like-minded people open to debate and seeking the best for this country has devolved into a cult of self-felating fascistic maniacs. I was a Never Trumper in 2016 but still didn't vote for Clinton and regretted it ever since. I voted for Kamala reluctantly but was devastated at her loss. Now I have to watch as my country further alienates its greatest allies.

So I asked her if she maybe know where it is, she knew about it but not the exact location and then she just started to going around and dig with me in the snow haha she even went to a nearby shack and got a snow shovel and stared digging with it.

He passed my part fine but when one of the other managers asked him to share his document with the team on video call, it took him 30 minutes to figure it out and he ended up doing a wrong type of document. \n\nThe man looked defeated before the interview started, clearly it\u2019s been a while since he\u2019s worked any corporate job. \n\nMan, seeing him try to relate professionally and try to impress us even though he looked very tired and past his prime made me upset.
