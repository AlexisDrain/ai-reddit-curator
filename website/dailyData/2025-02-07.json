"selftext": "My stbex-wife (soon to be ex-wife) cheated on me and I filed for divorce. She refused to leave the home we shared that's in my name and was in my family for two generations before me. I'm working on legally evicting her since the house is a pre-marital asset and she won't be entitled to it. But she wants the house and even moved her affair partner in. So I decided to change the lock on our bedroom door and I keep it locked up tight during the daytime.

But legal eviction takes several months where we are because she has rights, even squatters have a lot of rights technically. I tried to make her affair partner leave but he got mail sent here (which solidifies his right to be here) before I could get him out so now both are being legally evicted by me.\n\nThe guest room is very uncomfortable.

We never really got along, and he's always had trouble hanging on to a job, has multiple kids he doesn't see, just a really shitty situation all around. I didn't really need the money and with our parents gone, I have no real reason to interact with him. So I gave him my half of the estate and told him I'd rather we just part ways. It was one of the best decisions I've ever made. I'm happily living in another state and have no idea what he's up to, and have no desire to find out.

Without growth, they\u2019d need some 40% net margins to justify that, but actually net margins are just 10%-20%. Deserving a price-sales of just 4x at scale at best. Perhaps just 2x sales at 10% margins",

Sometimes too much freedom is a bad thing.\"\n\n[After I mentioned the lack of women's rights] \"Yeah but... that wouldn't really affect ME.\" Verbatim.\n\nThis dude is abrasive to work with (surprise surprise), publicly names-and-shames underperformers on his team, and regularly touches my arm or shoulder. He's also got zero filter and complains about whatever is on his mind, taking our meetings off track.\n\nUnfortunately he's a senior VP outside my chain of command, so not much I can do without losing credibility at work.\n\nBeing a woman is fun.",
