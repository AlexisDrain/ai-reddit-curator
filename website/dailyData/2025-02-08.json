He didn't love being poked, but he did great when distracted by treats.\n- Saddy has an ear infection (no mites!), so we were sent home with ear drops for him. I already gave him his first dose, and he handled it great when distracted with treats.\n- He lost about 2 pounds, and now clocks in at 13.5 pounds.\n- We have a followup appointment scheduled for March to get his microchip! He doesn't do great with needles, and it's a big one, so it's gonna be a sedation appointment. I'm hopeful we can also get his nails trimmed too.\n\nLet me know if I missed any questions! I'll try my best to work through the comments :)",

There's no deadline for success, love, or happiness. Live life on YOUR terms.\n\n3. Stay true to yourself: As you approach your mid-20s, you'll see a lot of shifts in the people around you. Some will put up a front for social media/validation, others might bend their values to fit in or get ahead. Don't feel pressured to follow suit, stay true to yourself.\n\nPS: You can add yours.",

I used to no life the game to grind the battle passes so I can get the insanely good deal of a bunch of skins for only ~15 bucks, now it's not even worth looking at for me. The S tier chest challenges kept me coming back constantly and the new changed system, albeit a bit worse, also had me playing the game more than I would just for a chance to get my favourite skin since I installed the game, Empyrean Pyke.  I have gotten so annoyed that I wasn't getting it from the bunch of chest/orbs I was getting that I was inching ever so closer to just straight up buying it but now I got no incentive to spend money now. The disrespect with removal is too much, you can't even have us have a CHANCE of getting a skin once a week? Shame...",

No one knows exactly when he showed up, but at some point, George decided that our campus was his home.\n\nHe spends most of his days lounging around, moving from one cozy nap spot to another, completely unbothered by the chaos of university life. His favorite place? A couch in our building, where he sleeps like he\u2019s paying rent. \n\nGeorge is loved by everyone \u2014 students, staff, and faculty. He gets plenty of attention, lots of pets, and possibly more honorary degrees than any of us. He even has his own Instagram because of course he does. \n\nHere\u2019s a collection of his best naps on our couch, featuring some honorable mentions from around campus. Enjoy George in all his academic glory!",
