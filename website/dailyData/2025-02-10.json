Like don\u2019t get me wrong, I didn\u2019t get much screen time but you can see me and I just wish they cared. To add insult to injury, I joined choir to work on my crippling stage fright that made it impossible for me to present in classes without having a full blown panic attack and puking.

The one exception to this ban is in the event of an emergency that affects the general public and where no other source of information is available, by mod discretion, screenshot posts will be allowed. \n\nWe apologise for the delay; it was due to us checking in with other subs (such as r/Sydney who have had a ban in place for years) on their experiences with implementing the ban to ensure we'd be able to get this working out the gate.  \n\nWe do reiterate that as a subreddit, Twitter/X links are very, very rarely submitted.  This is in part due to our rules regarding generating traffic for social media accounts but is also related to how our community interacts with news and current events.  The general preference from sub users for a very long time has been tow...",

Typically this logic is supported by all sorts of thinking: Women can have children, women are typically physically weaker, women are \"less logical\" and so on.\n\n**Funny thing is, when you flip their own logic back on them, they start hating it.**\n\nIf women are these delicate little creatures that can't be under physical strain then they should hold basically all white collar work, and men should do basically all blue collar work. I mean, men have NO place in the office, they're more likely to be violent, and their skills are better off in the field, right? If it's \"just biology\" then women should practice hypergamy instead of partnering up with a single person, afterall, why would women waste their time with average men when the creme of the crop can impregnate practically all of them?\n\n  \nI'm being facetious, but do you see what I'm gett...",

There's no trail or melted plastic anywhere else. Honestly, this pair of scissors just spontaneously combusted! I'm open to all theories, questions, or possible explanations.\n\nThe fire was put out by placing an empty metal popcorn bowl over the scissors. The scissors had been flat on the table whilst on fire. I then picked them up by the blades after a few minutes (still burnt myself), threw them in the bowl, and ran them to the sink to run cold water over them. That is how they got bent. I returned the scissors to the table for this photograph.\n\nScissors were about one year old, only used for cutting household packaging, wrapping paper, and copy paper.\n\nThey had been been used about an hour prior to open a bag of Smartpop. 3 witnesses. This occurred at night. ",
