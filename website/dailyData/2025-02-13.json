He spent just under two seasons with the Pistons from 1957-59 after being acquired from the Knicks. Although he was a solid big-man, he is perhaps best known for a game he *didn't* play in. Back with the Knicks in 1962, the 6'10 Jordon was sick with the flu (or hungover according to some claims) and unable to play in a game against Philadelphia and Wilt Chamberlain. The lack of Jordon's size in the lineup contributed to Wilt dominating for his historic 100 point game. Just three years later, the 31 year old Jordon drowned when the four person raft he was on broke apart in Puget Sound. His body was recovered from the water 20 days later.\n\n[Sonny Dove](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonny_Dove), whose mother was part of the Mashpee Wampanoag tribe, was the second Native American to play for the Pistons.

They never joined before. Well, dad used to. But it's been 11 or more years now since he did anything to honor our mom.\n\nMy dad wasn't happy when he found out we'd done something without him and his wife felt the same. They called my brother and me several times to complain about the secrecy and how we left them out of something important.\n\nFor the last 14 years my dad has described his wife as the love of his life. He also stated on multiple occasions that he was never as in love with anyone and falling for her made him realize his feelings for others were never close. While he's allowed that it stings us, the kids he had with his first wife who died....",

I want to address everyone who says it's fake - I understand why you think that, but this is my personal hell. I only listen to Reddit stories on TikTok, but when this reached its boiling point, I just needed a place to talk. So I made an account and tried to yell into the void. Well, the void turned out to be less empty than I thought!\n\nNow, to why everyone is here - the update:\nBefore I talked to my husband (32M), I decided to do some investigation. I started with his phone and read all the messages between him and Sarah. She bad-mouthed me a few times (he did nothing to defend me but didn't engage either). She was flirty; he wasn't really flirty back. They talked a lot, and he praised her frequently for her work ethic and intelligence. I didn't see anything about cheating.

When I was fired, they demanded the uniforms back.  I offered to keep the skirts and blouses that cost up to what I'd paid  to date (a couple hundred dollars worth), but they said no, demanded all items back, and refused to give me a refund.\n\nThey did say I could gather it all and bring it to them a couple of days later.  After thoroughly reading my contract, I confirmed I was only required to bring them back undamaged.  It didn't say they had to be clean.\n\nSo, when I got home, I poured everything in a big pile and called my cat over.  She was a long-haired cat who coated everything I owned in white fluff.

As I talked with him about nipping here and tucking there and putting things back where they were before children.... I just had this moment where I felt kind of outside of myself looking in. And there was a little voice telling me\"how is this going to serve your life?\". And I realized. It won't. Perky boobs and a flat stomach just don't seem that important anymore.

But, with that being said, I can never recall an issue to where the cable would be burned, along with the official EVGA ones. \n\nAs seen, the 5090 FE looks to be unscathed, but everything else was fried. If this was purely my fault then so be it. I should have remembered to purchase the correct corresponding cable. I plan to pickup another PSU (MSI 1300w) later in the week and see what happens. ",
