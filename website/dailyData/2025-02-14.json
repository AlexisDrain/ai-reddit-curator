Stopped by my local 5 guys for some dinner like I used to do almost weekly. Girl working there was my idea of a 10/10. She was super nice and I asked if it was okay if my dog joined me on the patio outside to eat. She said yes so long as she could come hang out and pet her. Which she did.

Police say the actor became \u201cbelligerent\u201d and refused to dress; he was later released on $1,000 bond. A court date has not been set. If convicted, McConaughey could face up to a year in jail and a $4,000 fine. \u201dWe\u2019re trying to piece everything together,\u201d says the actor\u2019s spokesperson.",

I'm saying I'm fine. I really can't even think of a single time she has a chance to screw around. \n\nI'm going to make an appointment with a urologist. \n\nI am still freaking the fuck out in my head. \n\nThis happened an hour ago and it's just weird. \n\nI'm 56 and she's 50, which is way to old to have a kid.\n\nETA Y'all are awesome. \n\nSomeone mentioned peri-menopause can cause false positives and a Google search shows this to be accurate. Rare but it happens. I've already mentioned it to her and her doctor has her on the schedule tomorrow. The complete ending of freaking out on her part pretty much put my anxiety to rest. I'll update in case anyone wants to know. ",

She also said her blood sugar was low and I noticed she was wearing a medical alert bracelet.\n\nI got her safely in my car and called the local police dispatch. They had a fire engine and an ambulance there within ten minutes. A swarm of more than half a dozen officers, firemen, and medics showed up and helped her and her dog into the ambulance.
