Except I didn\u2019t make one and I don\u2019t live in that city. So I patiently waited to cancel it today. \n\nToday I got another text saying \u201cyour reservation is at 6pm. Click the link to cancel.\u201d\n\nWell, bud, your girl is gonna be pissed you were too lazy to use your own number because tonight\u2019s reservation just got canceled! Happy V day, chump.

I said no, I don't have any cash on me, which was true. But once I got in my car I remembered I had three bucks in the pocket of my bag so I was like what the hell, it's Valentine's Day.\n\n  \nI got out and walked back ...",
