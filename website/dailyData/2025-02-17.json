"selftext": "Absolute imbeciles, the lot of them.\n\nBut since Adam Silver and the NBA needs some ideas on how to \"improve\" the All-Star game, here are some of my suggestions for future All-Star games.\n\n- If a player misses a shot, they have to lick Adam Silver's bald head.\n\n- If a player makes a shot, they still have to lick Adam Silver's bald head.\n\n- No more 2 pt shots allowed. Any shot attempt inside the 3 pt line results in an automatic ejection.\n\n- Reduce shot clock to 6 seconds.\n\n- Increase the size of the ball to be bigger than the size of the rim.\n\n- Make LaVar Ball the referee for the game. But give him a microphone and whistle that don't work.\n\n- All players have to wear pink tutus and rollerblades.\n\n- Replace the ball with Kevin Hart.\n\nHow bout you guys. Got some ideas to help Adam Silver for next year's All-Star game?\n\nEdit: Typo in the title. 'that' should be 'with'. Oof.\n\nEdit2: Added some more \"ideas\".",

I think the players were actually mad, and some made no attempt at hiding it. And frankly I don't blame them. Don't tell me I need to respect the game for the fans, and then go make a joke of me and my peers and disrespect me so badly by letting Kevin Hart talk his trash WHILE I'M PLAYING, have endless game stoppages for non-basketball reasons, and honor a bunch of commentators who continue to trash all the players game in/game out and then tell me to play hard the 5 minutes I get to play after sitting there for 30 minutes. \n\nSomething definitely happened to push players over the edge. Lebron refused to even put his jersey on for pictures. Ant suited up and warmed up and then decided last minute he wasn't playing (and then supposedly just left the arena after his game when he had participated in everything else all weekend...",

This is called dry rot, and it\u2019s caused by shoes sitting in storage for a while after being worn out once or twice, or not at all. Moisture is trapped in the PU rubber, and if it is not squeezed out by wearing, it rots the sole from the inside out.

I hate to say I told you so, but *we fucking told you so*. I mean it's all been so god damn blatant for years and now you're surprised? Have you had your head up your ass for the past 10 years??

Now stop asking inane questions and do something useful. \n\nReading books would be good. They Thought They Were Free by Milton Meyer and It Can't Happen Here by Sinclair Lewis in particular. Idfk.
