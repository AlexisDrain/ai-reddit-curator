"selftext": "I (30M) work in an office with a small team. A few months ago, my coworker Samantha (28F) had an emergency and had to leave work early. She was supposed to finish a report that was due the next morning, so she asked if I could help cover for her. I had some extra time, so I finished up her report and sent it in under both of our names to make sure she got credit.\n\nThe next day, she thanked me but seemed kind of off. A couple of days later, I was called into HR. Turns out, Samantha had filed a complaint saying that my \"taking over her work without explicit permission\" made her uncomfortable and that it felt like I was trying to undermine her. I was completely confused because (1) she had asked for help, and (2) I didn\u2019t take credit away from her.\n\nHR did an investigation, and after a week, they cleared me.

His little brother has been a one of the reasons the channel has been so successful because of his funny personality, although he is not in all the videos, however every one he is in are the ones that go viral. My 19 year old says he does all of the editing, the channel is in his name and he should be the only one making money. I suggested he give his little brother $200 a month towards his savings account, and he is really angry about it. Now, my 19 year old still lives at home, his only bill is his car payment. I\u2019m so disappointed in this situation. I feel my 19 year old is being really stingy. It\u2019s becoming a big deal in our house and causing resentment. ",

Im polite, kind, etc to her. \nAs she's leaving she says to me \"I hope you have something fun planned [for valentine's day] after you get off work\" in a very condescending and syrupy sweet tone in front of her friends. I look her in the eyes and say, \"actually my mom had emergency surgery yesterday and I'm gonna visit her at the hospital after I get off\".\nThe look on her face was priceless.
