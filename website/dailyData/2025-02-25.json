I\u2019ve told her it bothers me but she really just doesn\u2019t show any type of care about my own feelings.\n\nLast weekend, we went to a party at her friend's place. It was a chill night with a big group of our friends. But then, she had a few drinks and started \u201cjoking\u201d or just started completely flaming me.\n\nShe joked about how I\u2019m not helpful at home, how I almost burned the kitchen while trying to cook pasta, and how I have to watch a ton of YouTube videos to fix stuff. Many of the people laughed, which made me feel worse.\n\nThen, she really went too far. She said I\u2019m predictable and that sometimes she fakes being excited. \n\nAfter that moment, I stormed out with tears in my eyes.\n\nThe next morning, my phone was blowing up with calls and texts.

After delivering her CV to him and a short interview process, she was hired in a three-month probationary position.\n\nI was really excited to be working with Cindy. We could save money on gas by carpooling, spend more time together, and have lunch together too.\n\nUnfortunately, things did not pan out. To be frank, Cindy was a horrible employee. She showed up to the office 15-20 minutes late virtually every day. I had to give up on carpool...",

Her favourite spot to sleep was between our legs. She'll then pretend to be asleep, luling us into a false sense of security. When we're least expecting it, she will kick her back legs as hard as possible, directly into our groin. I started googling \"animals with very strong kicks\" and was completely gutted at what I saw. The only animal capable of kicking that hard was a kangaroo. And she looks exactly like one. \n\nSoon, everything began to make sense. The way she would lay in the sun for hours in the summer or curl up in front of the space heater in the winter, she was yearning for her homeland of Australia. \n\nShe also doesn't sit like a normal dog.

Used to roll my eyes when they'd fall asleep watching TV at 9pm.\n\nFast forward to me last night - passed out on the couch at 8:30, Netflix asking if I was still watching. Remote still in hand. Half-eaten dinner on the coffee table.\n\nIt finally hit me. My parents weren't boring. They were exhausted from:\n\n* Working all day\n* Managing a household\n* Worrying about money\n* Making sure I survived childhood\n* Pretending they had it all together\n* Dealing with their own parents\n* Carrying mental loads I couldn't see\n\nAll while I thought their main job was to entertain me and drive me to friend's houses.\n\nNow when I visit and my dad falls asleep in his chair, I get it. When my mom says she's \"just resting her eyes,\" I know.\n\nThe greatest sign of adulthood isn't paying bills or having a job. It's understanding why your parents were always so damn tired.\n\nAnd why they did it anyway.",

When I first sent out the invite, she asked if she could bring her child since she didn\u2019t have a babysitter. I sympathized but told her that, unfortunately, I really wanted to keep this an adult-only event, and I totally understood if she couldn\u2019t make it. She said she\u2019d figure something out and never brought it up again.\n\nFast forward to the night of the dinner. Everyone is arriving at the restaurant, and **Laura walks in, holding her daughter\u2019s hand**. I was immediately caught off guard but tried to stay calm.

"selftext": "I was given the machine as a Christmas gift a couple of years ago but never could find the time to dive in.  A few weeks ago I decided to finally fix my growing pile of ripped or otherwise beat up work pants.  \n\nI set the machine up in my living room and started bingeing YouTube sewing tutorials and something clicked.  This is fun.\n\nSo now, my work pants and Carhartts are in good working order, and I have a new growing pile of patterns for my girlfriend and I.\n\nI learned so much from YouTube, but especially big ups to my local sewing shop (Cut and Run in San Luis Obispo) and it\u2019s owner for answering all of my ridiculous beginner questions (\u201cWhat is\u2026 fusible interfacing?\u201d).\n\nPattern is McCall\u2019s M6044, fabric is cotton, sleeves and hem slightly shortened to fit my body, otherwise everything is straight from the pattern.",
