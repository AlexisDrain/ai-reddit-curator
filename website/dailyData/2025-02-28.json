As I began to eat, Luna came up and put her face in my sandwich and I gently nudged her away. She tends to do this whenever there\u2019s chicken (I\u2019m black and I don\u2019t like when she touches my chicken. She\u2019s got black beans so she\u2019s black too, but the difference is that I pay the bills). After I nudged her away, she put her face back in my chicken and I asked her what she was doing as I pulled the sandwich away from her. She replied \u201cmeow\u201d and it really hurt my feelings because I felt like she was being harsh. I told her that she needed to calm down to which she said \u201cmrrp\u201d and put her paw up to reach for my chicken. I told her no again gently and walked away with my sandwich so that I could eat in peace. \n\nA few hours later, she looked at me and meowed again but this time she got political.

It\u2019s because the guy who\u2019s supposed to be steering the ship is barely even at the wheel anymore. When he does show up, it\u2019s to threaten he\u2019ll leave unless he gets more shares, or to whine about the media and short sellers like it\u2019s still 2018.\n\nTesla used to be Elon\u2019s baby. Now it feels like some side hustle he\u2019s bored of, and it\u2019s starting to sink in for even his diehard fans. ",

I went to the dermatologist today because i woke up out of sleep crying from pain. and could not go back to sleep even after taking a benadryl!! it was that painful. turns out it was an allergic reaction to the mupirison which made my face 10x more inflamed and irritated. she also diagnosed me with Pyoderma Faciale. We think this is caused by the bacteria from strep that i had in November. (my face has been that bad for that long!!!) it now makes sense why i was misdiagnosed so many times and no one knew what the issue was and why no antibiotics or steroids were curing it. also makes sense because i got this OUT OF THR RANDOM!!! i have huge cysts all across my jaw line that are so tender and painful. she prescribed me 40 mg prednisone for 7 days, then 20 for 7 days, then 10 for 7 days, then 5 for 7 days to hopefully help the pain and inflammation.

Dragon opens its mouth, prepares for a breath attack that will hit everyone in the party. Everyone is behind the Sorcerer who got downed. Sorc asks if they can fail their death save to cast one last cantrip as a reaction. I allow it. They cast \"Control Flames\", and yell at the party to duck. Fire engulfs the area around and above them, but the Sorc extinguishes the flames in front of them. Everyone except the Sorc lives (the damage from the breath would've downed all but one of them), and they finish the battle.\n\nWhether or not a dragon's breath attack is considered \"nonmagical\" fire doesn't even matter. This moment was awesome and a hell of a way for the Sorc to go out (fire was a very prominent theme of their character). So happy with how this battle went.",

He continued acting for nearly three decades, turning what could have been his greatest setback into his greatest mission.\n\nThrough it all, his wife, Tracy Pollan\u2014his rock, his steady hand\u2014stood beside him with unwavering love and support. Together, they proved that true partnership doesn\u2019t just endure adversity\u2014it transforms it.\n\nIn 2000, he founded the Michael J. Fox Foundation, which has raised over $2 billion for research and led to a groundbreaking discovery: a biomarker that can detect Parkinson\u2019s before symptoms even appear.\n\nThat is what purpose, love, and an unstoppable spirit can do.I",
