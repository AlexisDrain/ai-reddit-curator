He\u2019s has been buried, I didn\u2019t have the guts to cremate him, I wanted his body to rest peacefully. It was devastating and hard to let him go so soon, but I\u2019m at peace knowing he no longer has to suffer anymore. \n\nCondolences are greatly appreciated \ud83d\ude4f",

To make it worse, they abandoned the joint press conference, leaving Zelenskyy to stand alone in front of the world.\n\nWhat message does this send? That we only help people when it\u2019s convenient? That we have no loyalty to those who trust us? That Ukraine\u2019s suffering is just a political game? I refuse to accept that as a reflection of who we are as Americans.\n\nTo President Zelenskyy and the people of Ukraine: I am so sorry. You deserve better ...",
