Their whereabouts have been unknown for years and Abdul\u2019s story was even featured on Unsolved Mysteries Volume 3: Abducted by a Parent.\n\nOn February 23, 2025, Douglas County deputies were responding to a burglary in Highlands Ranch, Colorado. Deputies interrogated 2 suspects and identified Rabia Khalid as one of the suspects. \n\nAbdul, now 14, and another unknown child were found safe and unharmed in a vehicle near by. Abdul\u2019s family is requesting privacy at this time but are thrilled to know that Abdul is alright.\n\nThis is such amazing news! I hadn\u2019t seen anything on the sub about Abdul, so my apologies if this is redundant.\n\nHere is an awesome article from the Denver Gazette that explains everything very well.\n\nhttps://denvergazette.com/news/crime/kidnapped-abdul-aziz-khan-found-douglas-county-colorado/article_e958fea2...",

I got so many DMs that I couldn\u2019t reply to all of them yet, but I promise I will whenever I get time. Seriously, I was in such a dilemma, and the support I received here was overwhelming. I couldn\u2019t even talk to anyone about this in real life, but complete strangers stood by me, gave me strength, and reminded me that I deserve better. You have no idea how much that meant to me. I was drowning in emotions, and this space gave me clarity when I needed it most.\n\nAfter my last post, I knew I couldn\u2019t sit with this information and pretend like everything was fine.
