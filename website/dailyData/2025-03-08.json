"selftext": "I have a cat who is my baby. She\u2019s super friendly but a little skittish, and I always remind guests to be gentle with her. A friend of mine came over the other night, and while we were hanging out, my cat jumped onto the couch near them.\n\nOut of nowhere, my friend shoved her off the couch. Not a little nudge\u2014an actual shove that made her hit the floor hard. My cat ran and hid under my bed, and I lost it. I asked them what the hell that was, and they just laughed and said, \u201cRelax, it\u2019s just a cat.\u201d\n\nI told them to get out immediately. They acted like I was overreacting, saying they didn\u2019t mean to hurt her and that it wasn\u2019t a big deal. But my cat was terrified, and I don\u2019t care if it was intentional or not\u2014that kind of reaction to an innocent animal is not okay with me.\n\nNow they\u2019re telling our mutual friends that I threw them out over \u201cnothing,\u201d but the response hasn\u2019t been what they expected. Most people are on my side, saying that was way out of line, and a couple even admitted th...",

I explained that, yes, things might shift a bit at home, but we could adjust. It wasn\u2019t like I was moving across the country just taking on more responsibility.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t convinced. He started making comments like, Do you really need a bigger job? and I thought we wanted to focus on starting a family soon. His tone shifted from concern to guilt-tripping. He even brought up how his dad always provided while his mom stayed home, how their marriage worked because they had clear roles.\n\nI reminded him that I wasn\u2019t quitting my job when we...",

Now for what it\u2019s worth, I worked in a donut shop until mid December of last year for some extra money while also working in my full time job. At first she kept saying I smelt like sugar and baked goods which I never took offence to, I worked with donuts on the weekends, it made sense. Once I accidentally spilt fruit juice all over myself and I guess the scent permeated my coat because when I went to work the following Monday (I worked Sat-Sun at the donut shop), everyone was noticing it smelt like orange juice.

Maybe it's some sort of intimidation tactic? Is it just so other have something to look at when speaking with him (Would he even care about that?)? He's gotten rid of everything else but not the face, he'll even some Maelstromers have less face than he does, so why does he keep it?",

One thing that drives me fucking insane is that you don\u2019t have a voice unless you\u2019re Japanese. They will befriend you, but they will NEVER see you as one of them. Even when you perfect their language and culture, you will never feel home here. Never ever. I honestly feel like i\u2019m some animal at the zoo. They think I\u2019m incompetent \u2014  in every way except my english skills, just because I\u2019m not Japanese.

It fit that movie imo, but now that it seems this style is reoccurring in all of their animation projects it feels lazy and corporate. How did we go from gorgeous Pixar animation to this being used over and over again? Elio didn\u2019t look interesting to me at all and I think part of the reason I don\u2019t feel bothered to watch it is this style being reused for a movie that (I think) is not supposed to have the same vibe as Turning Red.\n\nMaybe you guys will disagree but idk it just feels repetitive to me ",
