Apparently she found \u201cthe perfect place\u201d and convinced him to split it with her bc she \u201cdidn\u2019t want to rent anymore.\u201d So now, instead of us planning our future together, he\u2019s financially tied to his mother, who\u2019s going to be living there fulltime.\n\nI just stared at him like\u2026 wtf?? And when I asked where I fit into all this, he goes, \u201cOh, well, you can move in too, of course!\u201d Like I\u2019m supposed to be thrilled to live in a house his MOM picked out, partially owns, and is just\u2026 there all the time.

Driving a little over the speed limit so we go to work faster, That feeling of unease is your survival instinct kicking in. Don't dismiss it! My friend, Donni, learned this the hard way. He was walking home late one night and decided to cut through a park we usually avoided because it was poorly lit. We never risked it to go through there even though it would save us time, and he told me he was being paranoid, that it would save him 10 minutes. Literally the next day He was attacked and killed. All for 10 minutes. Trust your instincts. It's better to be inconvenienced than to risk your safety.\n\n",

"selftext": "Sorry for the excitement but I have to tell someone about this trick. Has it ever happened to you that you enter a cave, loot the entire place and find yourself with the misfortune that you do not have more weight available to carry more things? You have no positions of strength or a follower to help you. Well, NO MORE!! Find one of the bandits/skeletons you killed along the way, open its corpse and deposit all that damn extra weight. Then, revive them with a little conjuration, grab all the loot you're missing, exit the cave, and take a quick trip to the nearest city. Upon arrival, the reanimated corpse will be in pieces next to you, with all your extra loot! I know that for many it must be idiotic, but it just literally saved my life. Thx for reading &lt;3",

"selftext": "Made these cinnamon buns, and they\u2019re easily the best I\u2019ve ever had, the recipe is here: https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/perfectly-pillowy-cinnamon-rolls-recipe\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to let your mixer knead the dough for 15\u201320 minutes, this is the key to that pillowy texture, along with proper proofing. The dough should come together around the dough hook when it\u2019s ready, it will be quite soft and sticky at the beginning.\nI also changed the icing by adding more cream cheese and less icing sugar because their recipe was waaaay too sweet.",

That\u2019s all. I swear to all things holy. \n\n Fast forward to me driving home tonight and she turns off the music on the radio that I had turned on and starts trashing me about my family and how it\u2019s strange and creepy that I actually get along with my Mom, Dad and sister.

Moira thought it was a dig against her songs and her style and countered na kapag naarrange naman daw sa studio ang song ay hindi na magiging same sound. But Regine countered na hindi genre at song arrangement ang kinekwestyon nya but the use of manufactured airy vocals and deliberate tongue curling instead of the natural voice.",

We confirmed it was the same one and he shared that the cause of his tear was exercise related. He was basically using it as a chance to brag loudly about how much he could leg press in front of the young cute office staff ladies. Then he asked how I tore mine, with a tone akin to \u201cwhat could you possibly have done to tear yours.\u201d I smiled and answered, \u201cChildbirth.\u201d\n\nHe turned bright red and said, \u201cOh.\u201d The office ladies laughed at him and told ME how strong I must be. Exercise Bro stared at his phone until he got called back. ",

"selftext": "Okay, so. This might be confusing. I feel like I\u2019m losing my mind. 2-ish months ago this purple rubber band appeared in my house. My cat found it. Immediately bonded with it. It\u2019s her favorite toy. She sleeps with it. We play fetch with it. I have NO IDEA where it came from. I\u2019ve searched Amazon. I\u2019ve tried to Google it. I thought maybe it was a resistance band. I don\u2019t think it is - unless it\u2019s not American, this one isn\u2019t long enough. I thought it was a trash can band, but they\u2019re all much thicker and flatter. It\u2019s almost ready to tear in two places. Even taking these couple of photos she is PISSED I am touching it and not playing with her with it. She\u2019s the sweetest, smartest little angel and I just want to find her more before this one breaks. For the record, all of my cats have a favorite toy - we have backups for all of them. This just happen to be Pepper Jack\u2019s. Please please please help me. I\u2019m 7.5 months pregnant and I spend my evenings searching the internet for rubber ban...",

After 15days I received the same power bank but in working condition. I used it for 2months without any issues. \n\nToday morning I charged it using a 15V Samsung Type-C charger at 4 AM. By 10 AM, I unplugged it and placed it on my desk.

She was wearing a Chicago bulls singlet she was gifted a few years ago, as is the style at a Billie Eillish concert. \nDaughter was terrified, wife went crazy. Deliberately caused a scene (understandably) about grown men filming little girls. They claimed they \u201ccould do whatever we want\u201d and told my wife to fuck off after she demanded they delete whatever footage they had. Wife spoke to security, who then put a call out to find the guys. \nGirls all had a great time at the concert but were quite rattled. \nObviously these pricks have a channel where they prey on people for a quick reaction. If anyone sees on socials anyone doing these \u201cpranks\u201d around town last night please let...",
