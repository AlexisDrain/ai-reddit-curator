He isn't a bad developer, but he loves making it seem like he was doing more than he actually was. I\u2019m quite introverted, so I don\u2019t usually speak up in meetings unless I have to. Calling someone out directly doesn\u2019t come naturally to me, so I usually just let things slide.\n\nDuring a big project, I spent days fixing a complicated bug. The problem ran deep, and the fix had to work across different parts of the code. If you hadn\u2019t actually worked on it, it was pretty hard to follow. After a lot of testing, I finally got it done.\n\nAt the next team meeting, before I could even say a word, Steve jumped in and started explaining my fix as if it was his. He kept saying things like *\"We decided to...\" and \"Our approach was to...\"* making it sound like he...",

She is the most perfect bun that ever existed and she is so sweet, caring and lovely, her personality and routine matches mine perfectly. I wouldn't trade her for the world. But getting hurtful comments about how ugly she is or how dirty, and fat she is happens so often irl, and it makes me so frustrated I don't know how to deal with it. I'm not going to go into detail about how many insults that she have gotten over the years because that would be a really long list.

I arrived yesterday, spent the morning with his grandma since he doesn\u2019t have a car and was in class. She picked him up after and dropped us off at his moms apartment where he lives. He wanted to sleep together and I said no cause I was tired and what not. He got mad and said that sex is expected and accused me of cheating on him. This morning I asked him why I would spend money and time to come see him if I was cheating on him. He said women to do it all the time and men find out 50 years later that they kids aren\u2019t theirs and that\u2019s why men kill their families.\n\nI am still really upset and texted him, this was his response. Is his behavior reasonable? I feel like he is acting crazy ",

"selftext": "A brief summary of his condition and his passing followed by a small eulogy. \n\nMy baby boy Ozzy passed away today in my arms. A month ago he was diagnosed with Evan\u2019s Disease, with no underlying conditions to cause it. We treated him with Immunosuppressants, none of which his body responded to. \n\nThis morning, he couldn\u2019t walk anymore and didn\u2019t want any of his food. We took him to the vet to get a final assessment. We were set on euthanizing him at home, but as we went home he passed away in my lap, as I held him. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nOzzy was nine years old and before this condition came on so suddenly, I thought I had more years left with him. He was my sunshine, the joy of my life and my mother\u2019s life. He was always so expressive and ever the empath, seeking us out for cuddles when we were upset. He was amazing with children, being so gentle with them and always loved meeting new people. I was always proud of him whenever we went to the dog park as he approached every strange human he saw...",

If this is the direction you\u2019re heading in, you haven\u2019t just damaged your credibility\u2014you\u2019ve probably taken NMAT down with you.\n\nNMAT used to be a well-respected exam conducted by GMAC, a globally recognized body. However, after this mess, I doubt institutes like XIMB (HRM) or other top universities will continue accepting NMAT scores next year. And honestly, what was even the point of spending 3K on NMAT when you were always going to conduct another test that decides the selection? On top of that, you made us pay another 1K for this test after we had already paid 2K\u20133K just for the application fee. How do you even justify that?\n\nFor those who traveled, the costs went up even further\u2014easily another 20K for flights and accommodation. The entire selection process just feels so shady. And just to be clear, I\u2019m not ranting because I got rejected\u2014rejections are part of this journey. I\u2019m ranting because of the sheer...",
