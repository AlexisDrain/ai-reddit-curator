He wasn\u2019t an astronaut, but he was heavily involved in research and development for space missions.\n\nWhen I was a teenager, I asked him the big question: \u201cDid we really land on the moon?\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t laugh, didn\u2019t roll his eyes\u2014just gave me this tired smile and said, \u201cKid, if you knew how many people it takes to fake something like that, you\u2019d realize it\u2019s easier to just go to the damn moon.\u201d\n\nThat answer has stuck with me ever since.\n",

This is a wholesome rather than humorous update.\n\nHe was very personable and friendly, my friend and I were definitely starstruck. Apparently he flew 25 hours from Australia to be at the convention in my city, which is crazy to me, but we talked about that and I asked how he liked New Zealand and filming there. He said it was gorgeous and looks exactly like what you see in the Lord of the Rings movies. I told him we were very excited to meet him and grateful he came, and that Lord of the Rings means a lot to us.  He thanked us and was smiling the whole time. He autographed our picture with, \u201cTo [my name] and [my friend\u2019s name], Wonderful to meet you both! Best wishes,...",

Since it was incorrectly placed, the drink fell out of the carrier, and 200 DEGREE (yes, 200) fell onto his lap permanently damaging his groin. I don\u2019t see how this is the man\u2019s fault at all, of an over reaction. There was nothing he could\u2019ve personally done to prevent it, and now he has permanent damage because of it, by all means, give him the money!! ",
