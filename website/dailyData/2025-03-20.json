I have three other cats and after letting him get acclimated and then introducing them gradually he\u2019s been pretty normal other than spraying quite a bit, but I\u2019m hopeful that will stop after I get him neutered which is a top priority. One of my male cats had the same problem with spraying but stopped after being neutered. Anyways, he does this weird thing where he will grab my leg and wrap completely around it. He doesn\u2019t really move just holds my leg then lets go and does it over and over. I thought it was just weird behavior at first but I\u2019ve noticed he appears to be erect after doing it. Is this a form of self pleasure for him and has anyone else experienced similar behavior?",

Mostly because I had to call in favors to get my old part-time jobs back after I got fired in February, and it wouldn\u2019t be right to leave those part-time jobs high and dry without a proper 2 weeks notice especially since they helped me when I was in need. Of course I want my old job back, but I don\u2019t want to go back to work if I\u2019m just going to get fired again. My time and my mental well-being are both more valuable that money I\u2019d make.\n\nAlthough I\u2019m glad people are getting their jobs back, this doesn\u2019t feel like true justice, especially if they\u2019re just goi...",

We were tasked by the director with taking the linen home ourselves and washing it. Many of my coworkers just took it as part of the job, but I did not agree. We were hourly workers and that was blatantly a work related activity. When it was my turn to take the linen home, I clocked in on my phone prior to starting the washer, and clocked out only after I had taken out AND folded all of the linen. \nA week later my manager sends me a text questioning my extra time, and I simply replied with I was on the clock washing the linen. It was not long after that we had a new contractor coming by the office weekly to pick up and deliver fresh linen. ",

We gave our landlord a 30 day notice today and then we went over to our neighbors. \nAs you can imagine it was very emotional. I cried. she cried. Everybody cried. we all cried.  The cats cried. \nI don\u2019t know how to process this honestly. I was dreading having to do it. ...",

"selftext": "As of March 19, Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 has officially been in Steam\u2019s Global Top Sellers list for 104 weeks, adding up to two years and a longer time than its complete version\u2019s existence.\n\nThat means it has remained one of Steam\u2019s top 100 games in revenue since before its actual release, thanks to its strong early access sales. It\u2019s an incredible achievement for a game that isn\u2019t a free-to-play multiplayer title with fast-paced gameplay like Counter-Strike 2 or Apex Legends, which have been on the charts for even longer. This just proves how Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 continues to attract new players, even after such a long time.\n\nRead entire update on Destructoid",

But the more I thought about it, the more it irritated me. What is unprofessional, disrespectful, and uncomfortable about having a period? It just feels sexist. Would someone get uncomfortable by seeing an unused bandaid on my desk? \n\nShe used to pump her breast milk at work with the door closed, but she would leave the milk in our shared fridge. I didn\u2019t say anything because she had to do it since she was breastfeeding. It\u2019s completely normal. But something I do that\u2019s also normal is being called unprofessional.
