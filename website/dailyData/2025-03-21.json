"selftext": "The usa company Gillete has become almost a monopoly when it comes to modern mainstream razors.\n\nI have been using Gillette products as my go to solution for shaving, without giving it much thought. It is available at every supermarket and feels like the 'default'.\n\nNot any more though.\n\nMy repeating purchase of razors will support a European company from now on!\n\nYesterday I purchased a BIC razor with beautiful bamboo grip. It has four blades plus a lubricaring strip.\nThe clip on and off mechanism, between the handle and the razor cartridges, is smooth.\n\nBIC is a French company. They also make BIC shaving foam, an excellent replacement for the Gillette one.",

Walang dapat patunayan ang kabataan o sinuman para mapakinggan. Hindi niyo pagmamay-ari ang titulo niyo sa Senado. Bawal sa public service ang pikon, at lalo na ang duwag sa pananagutan.\n\nConsistent ang politika mo Sen. Bato: kinikilala lang ang boses at karapatan ng kapwa nasa kapangyarihan, pero hindi ng ordinaryong mamamayan. Halata sa madugong drug war na pinatakbo niyo na kolateral lang ang buhay ng walang kapit sa pwesto. Hindi kayo galit sa adik. Kayo itong adik sa pagpatay sa mahihirap na hinuhusgahan niyong salot ng lipunan.\"",

That led to a deeper conversation. She said she feels like my fianc\u00e9e doesn\u2019t like her sometimes. She never asks about her soccer games, and when she tries to share something exciting from school, my fianc\u00e9e tells her to stop being so chatty.

Alot of times you can hear the guest be baffled at some of the things he asks. Its sucks because he has some very interesting guests on, especially in the field of Astronomy and Cosmology.  He sounds like a Middle Schooler that got a chance to interview these scientists.     I wouldn't be so harsh on him if he was just some regular guy but he is supposed to be some highly intelligent Computer scientist and alot of times he sounds like he doesn't know how to tie his shoes.

I really loved the plot in this one, to have kuro get kidnapped by the Shogun and Sending Sekiro on a John Wick/Rescue quest throughout Japan in unreal. They really improved the combat system here too, much of the many concerns regarding Sekiros combat was it was opted for one for fighting against multiple foes but the rework around that was amazing. I love that Sekiro actually takes on 12-15 men alone and come out on top, especially since he's the one who has defeated prime isshin and the game treats us like the threat we are. The Beautiful Semi Open World of Japan and side quests were the most fun I had since Nightreign. That was my two cents, how was your Sekiro experience?",

It's not you, it's the system.\n* Once upon a time, someone measured a lot of people to create a \"universal\" sizing system. But who did they measure? Were outliers accounted for? What about people who got plastic surgery? What about different age groups?
