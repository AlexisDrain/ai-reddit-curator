"selftext": "I see a lot of people arguing that iMark\u2019s decision doesn\u2019t make sense, but I disagree. \n\nHe has always been an innie and treated accordingly - he\u2019s been constantly used, told what to do, lied to, and manipulated. He doesn\u2019t know who to trust or what to think. oMark has proven to him he\u2019s selfish with no regard or care for iMark (\u201cHeleny\u201d), he doesn\u2019t trust Cobel (for obvious reasons), and his outie\u2019s sister only cares about his outie (\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d in response to iMark asking what would happen to all the innies). \n\nWhat changed his mind to help Gemma was two-fold in my opinion. 1) Knowing she was an innie - 25 times - and that he himself was doing this to her.  2) Helly - someone he loves and trusts - laying out all the reasons he should. \n\nSo he\u2019s willing to help Gemma, but it\u2019s not for oMark, and he certainly doesn\u2019t have feelings for her. Waking up mid-kiss on the elevator reinforced this, which was reinforced even more when she went into the stairwell. He has this woman h...",

"selftext": "I\u2019ve been thinking about this a lot lately. We (millennials) have the largest gap in personal photographic records of any generation in the modern age. Not because we didn\u2019t take photos but because we lost them.\n\nWe lived through that weird in-between era:\n- Too late for shoeboxes full of printed Kodak photos\n- Too early for iCloud, Google Photos to back everything up\n- Right in the middle of MySpace, Photobucket, Friendster, and early Facebook\u2014with no one thinking to archive anything\n\nI\u2019m talking about:\n-Crappy digital cameras with SD cards that vanished in a move\n- Old flip phones and Razrs with tiny, pixelated videos of high school parties\n- College photos that lived only on a laptop that died in 2011\n- Entire friendships and phases of our lives lost with the deletion of a MySpace account\n\nWe documented everything, but most of it is gone. Billions of photos, probably. Compare that to Gen Z, who has their whole life in Google Drive or their Snapchat Memories. Or Gen X, who have ph...",

Whenever I needed to go to the bathroom they would run in first and take their sweet time just to irritate me and make me suffer. \n\nIt went on for a long time and one day I just about had it. We had 2 cats and 2 litter boxes. One day he went running to the bathroom and was just playing on his phone and plucking his face hair and refused to let me go so I decided I would just go poop in the cats litter box. \n\nNot only was it a big poop, but I also peed a little. The cats litteraly wouldn't use that litter box after and then my ex came and was investigating it and saw, and he goes \"wow they pooped alot no wonder they want their box cleaned\" and I just sat there and watched him clean up my shit and piss. That was near the end of our relationship and he never found out. ",

My family spent years finding everything, including reclaimed wood for the floors and three-story foyer. \n\nWe are leaving the country and it is breaking my heart to sell my childhood home.

And now I can't even comprehend that 2/25 was weeks ago, it still feels like yesterday.\n\nI still think I see her out of the corner of my eye some days.

The pattern is called Verticals (free on the Fat Quarter Shop) and I used three northern lights panels from Missouri Star for the designs. I cut them into strips and then chopped them up and laid them out in a way that made sense to me!\n\nI was inspired by friends who are super into the northern lights after getting a chance to see the lights from their backyard in Michigan (picture 3)! I wanted to make a quilt for them and when I saw this pattern and found the panel, it was meant to be. \n\nTo finish this one, I got it longarmed at my LQS and I LOVE how the design adds so much motion to the verticals. I was unsure if the waves would have enough effect but they turned out perfect!! I almost wish I wasn\u2019t giving it away - I\u2019m so proud of it!",
