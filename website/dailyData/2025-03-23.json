She could have drawn a dick on me if she felt like it. The lack of control is a chaotic part of the tattoo itself.\n\nThe black arrows are The Hand of Eris, a discordian symbol representing order and disorder constantly opposing each other leading to chaos. Discordianism is a \u201creligion\u201d spawned out of 1970s psychedelia. Pretty sure shrooms were involved. We aren\u2019t allowed to eat hotdog buns.\n\nI am beyond happy.",

No one will know the trees are there because it makes me feel at home (I grew up in the heart of the redwood forest) and the fonts were chosen carefully because I\u2019m a graphic designer and I know my husband would\u2019ve chosen Papyrus and Comic Sans to just be funny and make me roll over in my grave! \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd2d\n\nWe post so m...",

My parents backed him up, saying we should \u201cturn the weekend into a family celebration instead.\u201d I shut that down immediately.\n\nHere\u2019s where it gets messy since I was supposed to be a bridesmaid, my brother suggested that I step in as his \u201cplatonic plus-one\u201d to help smooth things over with guests.

Suddenly, Careless People wasn\u2019t just another tech whistleblower book;\u00a0it was the book Mark Zuckerberg didn\u2019t want you to read, and for many, that\u2019s enough to recommend it. In the week following its release on March 11, Careless People hit the top of the Times best-seller list and sold 60,000 copies. It\u2019s selling out in New York bookstores and prominently displayed in the ones that still have it. The book has taken on an air of persecution, even scarcity \u2014 as much as something freely available on Amazon (it\u2019s now No. 3 on the Amazon best-seller list) can be called those things.",

I ate a little under half of them and the rest went to the animals.\n\nNo candy roasters have gone bad, I've only ate 3, I save them for spring/early summer since they store really good.\n\nStill have about half my garlic left and all the acorn squash are gone\n\nI've added lard, all the jelly, walnut syrup and another batch of apple sauce.

"selftext": "So I wanted to get my best friend a nice birthday cake, I normally make my friends and family cakes myself as in the past I haven\u2019t really had money to get one made professionally. So this year I found a bakery in town that had good reviews, and I checked out their Facebook profile. Most of their stuff looked really nice so I felt like I was making a safe choice going with them. \n\nI said I wasn\u2019t picky about the color just not a blue-ish green. I even gave some examples of the color I was looking for. I got the cake today and it\u2019s borderline teal?? I didn\u2019t say anything in the store because I was nervous and thought maybe it was bad lighting, also I really just didn\u2019t want to be one of those people. But now I\u2019m home and looking at it and I want to cry because I paid $45 for this and I can\u2019t even think of how to fix it. My other friends say I should try to get a refund, but I feel like I should have done that earlier before paying for the cake. I\u2019m so frustrated, but I don\u2019t know if ...",

Funny, genuine, hardworking, always the first to offer help, always the last one to leave a party because he stayed to clean up. He always looked for an excuse to get the family together, to fire up his grills and break out the bourbon. The last time he did it was his 50th birthday. A month later, almost to the day, he suffered a massive heart attack and died. I stood with him as groomsman, as did our younger brother-in-law (30s), and a good friend of Heath\u2019s. Six months later, in the same church, we were his pallbearers.\n\n.\n\n\nTo say our family was (and still is) devastated is an understatement. Our side of the family is a close-...",

This event took place on a school football field in the spring sun, and crowds were very helpful trying to assist each other with getting water and coordinating with paramedics. Tucson beat their turnout by at least 5,000 people and some reports are saying there *may* have been more than 20,000 in attendance.\n\nBernie has been talking about how this needs to be a grassroots movement. HERE is your grassroots movement. Dont stop fighting! They want you discouraged! This is america and we fight for our people!",

"selftext": "About a month ago I made a post about how much I didn't like my newborn. She was 8 weeks old. \n\nWell a few days later I took her back to the doctor. He put her on dairy free formula, Alimentum (Which smells like potato stroganoff. Ew). The changes started overnight, and the very next day, I woke up and looked in her basinet to see an awake baby giving me the biggest, cheesiest smile in the world. Since then her personality has shown through drastically. It's honestly really fun to witness. My husband has also been an enormous help. Reassuring, letting me sleep, helping every moment he can. He also went back down to a normal amount of hours at work, to help me more.\n\nIt's still rough. She still doesn't sleep fully through the night. I consider her being a little more of a firecracker to be part of her personality, she might never be as easy as her sister. But I wouldn't change her if I could. Her sister and her are night and day,  totally different. But I can honestly say I love it. ...",

"selftext": "I was looking through a local vendors mall, scouring for records and found this. I thoughy the cover was cool so I picked it up and it actually is not too bad an album. Its full of parodies of classic rock songs; some being the title song: Born to add, a parody of Bruce Springsteens Born to run; Letter B, a parody of The Beatles Let it be; Count it higher, a parody of Twist and shout; and many more. Obviously the parodies are aimed towards children but a good amount of them really aren't too bad. Letter B cracked me up when I first heard it since I couldnt originally place what the song was supposed to be parodying. \n\nJust wondering what albums you guys have picked up just from there being a cool picture on the cover.",

Sobrang swerte ko na nahire ako sa as full-time sa isang US-based company. Triny ko lang mag apply sa kanila nung January kasi nakita ko posting nila sa LinkedIn na may nakalagay over 100+ applicants kaya alam ko sa sarili ko hindi ako mapipili. Nagulat ako na ako yung napili nila out of hundreds of applicants during the interview. Medyo comfy naman na ako sa sweldo ko previously (earning around 35k) pero ang tagal umangat kasi ng sweldo.\n\n\nNakakaiyak tbh, dami ko rin sinacrifice dito just to build my career. Literal na after day job, portfolio building, binibigyan ko oras a day mag personal work kahit may times na nakaka burnout. Minsan di na nakakasama sa gala with people. So...",
