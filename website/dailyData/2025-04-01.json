I created this image using ChatGPT's Sora that outputs more realistic images than the ChatGPT app.\n\nAlam naman natin na ang sub na'to ay kalimitan tungkol sa mga chismis ukol sa mga celebrities na prone talaga sa mga deep fakes sa kasikatan na rin nila. Kaya't maigi na maging mapagmatyag at mapanuri tayo sa ating ishinishare na \"gossips\" with pics ng mga celebrities dahil di pa natin alam kung talagang totoong pics yun o AI-generated. Lahat tayo na gumagamit ng internet ay prone sa deep fakes, di lang mga celebs.\n\nMaging mas matalino sana tayong mga Pilipino sa patuloy na pag improve ng mga AI. AI is inevitable and we need to adapt, otherwise we'd be left behind. And adapting requires improving our critical thinking skills as well, to be able to distinguish from truth to fake news.\n",

With many events affecting both Reddit and the world increasing in both size and scope, it can be very overwhelming. Over the years we have noticed that online discussions have become increasingly toxic and it has caused adverse mental health effects for both the users and the moderators. \n\nTherefore we have come to a collective decision to change the purpose of the sub from its original purpose to its namesake: posting Anime Titties. From now on the only posts allowed will be posts of anime titties involving voluptuously breasted men and women. Please note that due to Reddit changing rules after the API protests, we would like for the pictures to be technically safe for work. This means no full frontal nudity and females must be wearing at least some cover for their titties. Without further ado, non anime titties posts will be restricted and only anime titties posts wi...",

First, i\u2019ll state that despite being the only traditional home, it is the only one of the alternate home spaces that is not able to function as an alternate home. It lacks some of the basic functions of the normal home spaces, such as a full Codex, a Mods and Arcanes station, a Nightwave radio, a Relic stand, a Helminth, a Foundry, Railjack access, and (most importantly) a Navigation Console. While it does provide some extra features such as Drifter intrinsics, Acrithis, and a dedicated Duviri access point, that barely makes up for the rest of the hole in my heart left by the fact that there\u2019s not even an option to make the Dormizone a Base of Operations \ud83d\udc94.
