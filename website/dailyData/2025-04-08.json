Especially since she\u2019s not even my real mom.\u201d\nAnd points to me.\n\nEveryone laughed.\n\nHer dad laughed. His wife laughed.

I told him it was taken, that my husband was in the bathroom. He then asked, \u201cWould he mind switching with me?\u201d and pointed to a seat way in the back of the plane. I didn\u2019t hesitate.

Small crowd sizes are the biggest blows to his ego. \n\n2. Anyone showing up is going to be used to inflate crowd size numbers. Trump has had photos doctored before to show more people attending that don't exist. I would not put it past him to have videos and photos doctored to look like he's being supported.

And it's the funner stuff. The celebrate the good stuff. Remember her and the fun we had stuff. And there's no more bed with mom lying in it. Every day, coming in and sitting there for 2-4 hours with her in the bed. Watching her erode away. She's at peace now. \n\nI miss her deeply. It'll be worse before it's better.

"selftext": "While I was asleep one Sunday, a series of explosions woke me. I live in the country, so usually these are gunshots being fired by our next-door neighbor--who doesn't use a berm or backstop. It sounded like something fell down in my closet, so I went to check--and there was a hole in the wall that went into my Tupperware bins full of Pokemon. Turns out my idiot neighbors shot a bullet into my house, and an Incineroar theme deck stopped it. The actual 9mm bullet was still inside the box. If it hadn't been there, it would have likely struck me while I was asleep as it was level with my bed.\n\nA lovely man at our LCS bought me a new theme box and I'm okay, but I now count Incineroar as my guardian angel Pokemon and have never been happier to have piles of cardboard in my box. You never know--they might stop a bullet!",

Does anyone have an explanation for how this was even possible? Thank you in advance.\n\n\nEdit: Just adding some extra details since a lot of people are asking similar questions. \n\n\u2022 Multiple family members witnessed this\n\n\u2022 It was confirmed that he wasn't touching or leaning against the vanity in any way\n\n\u2022 He was standing completely upright and had his hands in the sink but not touching it, as though he was going to wash them\n\n\u2022 He was in his 70s, possibly 80s, and did have a lot of serious health issues",

He spoke German then Lemonhope replied, \u201cThat\u2019s what mistress used to say.\u201d After, he proceeded to explain LH\u2019s method of thinking which only PB would know since Phlannel Boxingday had only just met him recently. \n\nHe ALSO said he couldn\u2019t go into Lemon Grab territories because he doesn\u2019t want to get involved in their politics which is virtually what PB said an episode earlier. \n\nAND HE\u2019S PINK!!\n\nI get that I didn\u2019t notice this on my first watch but I can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve watched this episode at least 5 times and it flew over my head.\n\n\nIt reminds me of when PB dressed up as Martin to help Finn get over his desire for revenge. What kind of therapy is this? Lol\n",
