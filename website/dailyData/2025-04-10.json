"title": "\"90 day delay except China\" was leaked 1 day before the actual announcement. White House denied it because their insider traders were not positioned yet and they didn't want markets to rise before that. This is the biggest insider trading scheme in history.",

They made dozens of billions (if not hundreds) in matter of hours. Government artificially dumped the market and pumped it in matter of days to enrich bunch of people. This is the biggest corruption event in US history but since rule of law is in shambles nobody will actually do anything about it.",

I then told him to get out of the car and that he\u2019d be walking home from now on. \n\nMy wife is pissed at me now. I honestly don\u2019t see a problem with it. We only live 10 minutes from the school and when I made him get out of the car we were less than 3 miles away. I\u2019m not sure about nowadays, but when I was in school most kids walked way farther everyday.\n\nWas I too harsh with my punishment? My wife is also adamant that what he said...",

I tried to talk more about the position but the whole thing felt disrespecting due the fact here where 2 trainee's watching and nobody told me of an all out panel interview.\n\nI answered a few rapid-fire questions and then told them I didn\u2019t find this a pleasant way of recruiting and walked out. \n\nEveryone was flabbergasted including myself.   \nMust been a world record.",

"title": "YSK that your alarm ringtone might be doing more harm than good",
"selftext": "Why YSK: The type of ringtone you use to wake up in the morning could be doing your body harm. If you use a loud and harsh ringtone to wake up, the sudden jolt increases your stress and anxiety levels. This can lead to a bad start to the day, and contributes to grogginess. It can also increase your heart rate and raise your blood pressure. And whenever you hear that same ringtone outside of your morning routine, it can trigger the same stress response automatically. Instead choose a quiter alarm with a less harsh sound such as bird noises. You can also try tuning your natural circadian rhythm by practicing sleep consistency in order to wake up on time without an alarm. Other things that help include leaving your curtains slightly open so the morning sun wakes you up.\n\n  \nSource: [https://news.virginia.edu/content/waking-your-phone-alarm-it-could-be-putting-you-risk](https://news.virginia.edu/content/waking-your-phone-alarm-it-could-be-putting-you-risk)",

Now I will occasionally see 5 or 6 crows waiting patiently in the tree in front of my house, crapping, and looking especially creepy (but surprisingly not making a whole lot of noise to give away our secret to the other, nicer neighbors) They have also not crapped on my car in my driveway once, (not once!) in all the the past months I've been treating them. The trees mostly cover the street area anyway. Edit: If you know crows, they are legion, and if my neighbor decides to retaliate, there will surely be a full on war...",

"selftext": "This guy has been in the neighborhood for a couple years and has very very slowly warmed up to me and my cats that are indoor/outdoor. He likes sleeping in our backyard even though our small dog will run him off if she notices him. I started feeding him a couple times a week if I noticed he's around since I want to gain his trust so I can get him neutered (he looks beat up from a fight he was in last week...hoping no balls would mean less fighting) Yesterday after getting out of the shower I sit down on the bed and suddenly a streak of fur jumps up into the window and on to the top bunk. I had caught him trying to come in once before but he bolted as soon as he saw me. He wasn't very happy that I was taking his picture. He ran right back out of the house which requires going down a hallway and through the dining room so he seem to be familiar with the layout of the house. It makes me wonder if he's been in the house before without us knowing. ",

There are times on the internet when someone is very overwhelmed by some feelings, that they do things or post things without thinking, and then, when they cool down and reflect, they come to their senses and get rid of those posts.

This is the same horror rerun we\u2019ve been force-fed since Trump slithered back into office in January 2025 like the greasy reboot of a show that should\u2019ve been cancelled for crimes against decency. Trade tariffs were \u201chere to stay\u201d? Then poof, like a fart in the wind, he changed his mind. The man has the spine of a jellyfish, the ethics of a cockroach, and the attention span of a mosquito on meth. But it\u2019s not just about his pathological flip-flopping. This is a weaponized game of market manipulation. He tanked the stock market on a Tuesday, then reversed course on Wednesday, just in time for his billionaire friends to cash in. That\u2019s not leadership. That\u2019s insider trading with a podium and a Secret Service detail.\n\nThis is what you get when you let a reality TV clown wear the mask of legitimacy. This is what happens when you treat democracy like a YouTube prank channel. While Biden was still president in July 2024, the stage was already being set....",
