I hope that just reflected the bump in the stock market on his total holdings. I asked my Schwab rep if Mr. Schwab would be making a public statement denying involvement in an insider trading scheme and releasing his personal trading history over the past few days to prove that he wasn't. She said she'd get back to me. I also let her know that my 30 year relationship with Schwab was dependent on a receiving a reasonable answer to my question. I don't think Mr. Schwab would do anything that stupid but then again...\n\nUPDATE: the whole point of making this post was to try to get people fired up to hold a company accountable. At first appearance, what was said in that video does not look good for Mr. Schwab. The presidential election may be over but we can still vote with our dollars. \n\nSchwab was concerned enough when ...",

My dad died when I was 6 and it was just me and my mom for a few years before she met Dan. Dan was okay and they got married a little over a year after they met. I was 11. A few months after my mom and Dan got married, Dan's ex said she wanted to move with their daughter to another state. Instead of saying no and fighting it Dan and my mom decided we would move to follow them and that had us moving 8 times in 5 years just so he could follow his daughter around. He never fought it in court and they uprooted me every time too.\n\nI was resentful as hell. I was away from the rest of my family and chasing after a stepsister I didn't really care if I never saw again. I know my mom cared and Dan cared and they were married. But I felt so unsettled when we never knew how long we'd stay and Dan even admitted his ex didn't want us nearby so she'd keep moving when she could.\n\nBut...",

My intuition tells me that he might do the same thing himself on his remote days, although he has a hybrid schedule.

He\u2019s been in and out of the hospital and struggling to teach. He\u2019s been doing dialysis for a while now.  Long story short he was taken off the list for a new kidney then a few months later added back. The doctors were telling him that he was going to age out soon. Like less than six months. Well today he called her and said that they found him a kidney and he\u2019s going in for surgery tomorrow!! I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m getting emotional about it. I guess it\u2019s just because he doesn\u2019t have anyone in his family outside of his sister and us. I mean I don\u2019t even hang out with him. But whenever I see him we talk and get along. I\u2019m just really happy for him. I apologize if this is the wrong place for this but I had to share something positive. ",

According to her, diamonds are \"forever\" and \"magandang investment kasi tumataas ang value.\"\n\n\nIn her mind, those pieces were our emergency fund. Our inheritance. Our fallback.\n\n\nShe estimates she spent around 2M pesos total over the years.\n\n\nShe assumed by now, the value would've doubled to 4-5M pesos.\n\n\nBut when my dad got sick last year, we finally tried to cash in on this so-called \"investment.\"\n\n\nNagulat na lang kami that the pawnshop offered us 35k for the whole collection.\n\n\nJewelry buyers from binondo and bulacan even warned us: \"Mam, this is mostly low-quality and non-certified stones. Hindi to pang-resale.\"\n\n\nShe bough most of her jewelry from door to door jewelers like the good old days.\n...",

I\u2019m sure we\u2019ve all seen the recent uptick in awareness of Autism, but very few people actually understand it and worse it\u2019s almost become a byword that means something entirely unrelated to the actual medical condition. It\u2019s almost analogous to \u201cnerd\u201d or just having a passionate hobby. Sure, all of us have that, but like. That doesn\u2019t mean autistic. Universal Healthcare is a feature of all socialist countries but it in and of itself is not socialism. Seahorses are not actually horses. \n\nOn the one hand all of us are intimately familiar with the crushing isolation and loneliness that comes with autism, and yes I would very much like to have what the post describes done to me, but on the other hand we all know very well that these people do not want an autistic partner\u2026 they don\u2019t even want a real nerd ...",
