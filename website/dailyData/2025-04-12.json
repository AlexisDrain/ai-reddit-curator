So stoked, I hooked it up got the software updates and then it says \"your access to the PlayStation Network (PSN) is temporarily or permanently prohibited\". Called Sony and gave them the serial number and they proceed to tell me the console was listed as stolen...... HUH?!\n\nThey gave me a support link for PS Direct, chatted with a guy there who just apologized. Said he had to escalate and I'd get an email within 24 hours about it. Anyone ever heard of this? Sony selling banned consoles from PlayStation Direct? What the actual fuck?!\n\nEDIT: Sony rectified the issue and unlocked my console, woohoo!!  They said all they know is it was a \"technical error\".  I don't know what that means but at least it was quickly resolved.",

The generosity in content, in POE1 and 2. The interviews. The quick patch notes adressing a lot of things brought up my the community.  \n\n\nAnd on this reddit, they get constantly flamed, it's crazy. Some comments and posts I see are borderline hateful towards them.  \n  \nOf course they have some visions they have to defend, because as a dev, you can't just blindly take all the feedbacks from the players and put it in your game. You have to be careful. Especially feedbacks from people with 10k+ hours, i mean those players are a SUPER IMPORTANT part of the community but they also have very specific and weird needs that new players just don't understand haha. \n\nAgain, sorry if you're not a big fan of POE2, that sucks. And it sucks that POE1 is not taken care as much this year. \n\nBut for real. We are blessed with the peopl...",

On Tuesdays we go out to eat. She says we take turns choosing the restaurant but I get to choose almost every week. On Fridays we order pizza and watch a movie and eat ice cream in our pajamas on the couch. When I started middle school she started taking me to get my nails done with her so now we do that every other Saturday and at least once a month (sometimes more during summers or school breaks) we get to visit her condo in the mountains.

That\u2019s terrible, right? Nobody should eat red meat!\n\nThe problem is, when something is conveyed as a percentage, it\u2019s almost always a percent of some previous baseline.  For instance, if the chance of getting cancer is 1% across your life, a 35% increase means an increase of **35% of 1%**, or 0.35%.  In other words, in this example, red meat increases your chance of developing colorectal cancer from 1% to 1.35%.  It\u2019s a difference, but for an individual it\u2019s a relatively small difference.\n\nWhen many people hear a fact like this, their mind interprets it as a \u201cpercentage point.\u201d  Using the previous example, if red meat increased your chances of getting colorectal cancer by 35 percentage points (35%pp), it would mean your chances increase from 1% to 3...",

She handled every day of her long life like a fluffy little warrior.\n\nI brought her home when I was 6 yeard old. Mom wasn't expecting this at all but in the end she gave up and allowed me to have her. I took her from my kindergarten's friend. She had a character since her first months and she didn't behave good at his home so they decided to give her away. They gave her name Alice and we kept it. I've seen this name only a few times since then so it was fitting her perfectly and it was unique as she was.\n\nShe actually had a \\`tortitude\\`. She was full of energy and interest to everything around. She liked running around the flat, hissing at any guests and pooping wherever she wants. But it never affected my love to her. I think she was the main reason for me being a cat person and me having a soft and emotional character. But she also was very supportive and whenever I felt bad she always came ...",

(': \n\n\nI know there is some debate on the life-size of rayquaza especially since the anime likes to size up this pokemon by a lot for visual effect, but pokemon home states rayquaza is 23 feet and serpentine creatures in real life are always measured in length so this is what I went with (: \n\nMy partner in the second to last photo is 6 feet tall for reference (: \n\nThis project is why I haven't had a ton of updates for a lot of my current commissions, hopefully you all understand now why I have been taking so long \ud83d\ude05 I will be taking a break for a couple days to recharge and then powering through commissions a lot faster now that this beast is finished \u2728\ufe0f ",

"selftext": "My house backs up on a public park with sports fields and is four houses from the park entrance. The entrance to the park is a sidewalk that cuts between two houses and there is no parking lot, so street parking only. \n\nThere is a fire hydrant in front of my house. It is clearly marked- bright yellow, curb painted, and an orange flag sticking out of the top. Despite this, people visiting the park for various sportsball activities routinely miss it and park in front of it.\n\nThree weeks ago, club baseball started. For whatever reason, baseball parents tend to be more observant than other sportsball parents and generally leave a decent gap. \n\nWeek 1: I was heading out with the dog when I noticed a distinctive electric truck attempting to wedge into the gap. Doggo and I waited for him to finish and told him about the hydrant. He told us to fuck off. \n\nWeek 2: We\u2019re coming back from our walk and notice that not only is he blocking the hydrant again, but he has a ticket. Later, my husband...",
