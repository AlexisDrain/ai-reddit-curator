We knew what we had to do today, we knew we had pace in the car and two drivers who can deliver results. We weren't dreaming of a double-points finish but honestly, the way we ran the race, how the drivers drove, we had conviction, and we were proactive - we weren't afraid of anything. I'm really happy to see how everyone is reacting to disappointment - it's racing, so there's going to be highs and lows. It's easy to ride the highs, but not easy to overcome the lows and put a performance like this in. It was another amazing team effort.\" - via haasf1team.com",

Daarvoor heb ik op diverse plekken in Nederland gewoond. Veel problemen in Nederland speelde voor mij niet zo. Daarom was migratie voor mij een groot onderwerp. Ik kon mij zo ongelofelijk storen aan niet ge\u00efntegreerde mensen. Even wat voorbeelden:\n\n* Enorm Turks nationalistische Nederlanders. Je woont hier al 4 generaties. Waarom zwaai je toch met die Turkse vlag en stem je op Erdogan?\n* Ik schat dat ongeveer &gt;80% van het geweld, ongepast gedrag, intimidatie, diefstal dat ik in mijn leven heb ervaren van mensen met een migratieachtergrond is.\n* Ik heb enorm veel problemen ervaren met mensen uit ...",

Oscar nominated for \u2018Closer\u2019, Children of Men was tremendous, I mean he was heavily favoured to be James Bond before Daniel Craig showed up. And then, he just faded. He still works and acts quite regularly but he never got even close to those heights again. What are some other actors that just fell off of the top tier but there\u2019s no real reason why. ",
