The administration admitted it was an error. The Supreme Court ruled in his favour. There is no doubt that this was wrong. It wasn't just legally wrong, it was morally abhorrent.**  \n\nKilmar Garcia was an El Salvadorian citizen who was recently deported. Garcia immigrated illegally to the U.S. in 2011 at the age of 16.

I go by the tag of Equinox and I wanted to say that I had the pleasure of meeting Jennifer English who is the English voice actress for Carlotta, Shadowheart in Baldur's Gate 3 and Latenna in Elden Ring! I was so happy to meet her and the fact that she was at a close location made it even better. Talking to her was a pleasure as she told me she loved playing Carlotta in her entirety and that Kuro Games was one of the nicest companies that she's worked with. She was so passionate about voicing Carlotta we both geeked out for 5 minutes straight talking about the companion quest and more. Definitely one of the best days of my life that I'll cherish for a lifetime.\n\nAnyways thank you so much for reading this far if you did! I just wanted to post this because I wanted to share how excited I was to meet her \ud83d\ude2d",

With one hand on the blanket, I am surprisingly able to grab all 16 pounds of her, but my door slams shut behind me. So I am trapped outside my apartment without pants on while holding my cat. I knock on the door of the apartment across from me and thankfully a woman answers. I blurt out, \u201cCan you call a locksmith?\u201d She lets Pam and me stay in her apartment while the locksmith gets my door open. The poor woman is on a work call while I sit on her couch pantsless and Pam cries under it. $188 later, I have a new friend and a funny story, but I will never open the door without pants on again.",

They no longer dance at clubs and even posting their favorite sandwich or tagging a friend in a post must be meticulous and up to you...",

I would have never thought to receive so many comments, so that's why I think it's fair for me to update everyone about this situation.\nYesterday I called the DVLA asking for clarification and here is the result: AS WEIRD AS IT SOUND THIS LETTER IS LEGIT!\n\nI don't blame anyone for thinking that this letter was a possible scam cause it's seemed fishy for many different reasons. However, the guy I spoke to on the phone, told me what was the mistake on my driving licence (a minor detail on the back of the licence).\n\nI want to thank everyone who left a comment in my previous post\ud83d\ude4f",
