I had heard rumors of this happening, but thought it was rumor/hoax.\n\nI sold an RTX 4090 couple weeks ago. Something about the buyer setoff some alarm bells. It was a huge ebayer. One of those with like 30k feedback and a storefront. Why would they pay retail for my GPU? The address was business in California and the buyer name seemed \"odd\". So I took a ton of pictures, got mega insurance, tracking etc.\n\nSame day they receive it they start a return. \"no video\". This card was pristine, I'm am engineer and I barely used it. So I get the card back and man it had seen some ...\\*\\*\\*\\*. The mounting bracket was bent up. Couple wired were crossed on the RGB.\n\nI called ebay, was nice but 100% this damaged I will go to court. Ebay said keep the card, keep the money, we will give them a one time refund. \"wow ok\". \n...",

Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg and the rest of Facebook's (now Meta's) executives are disgusting, and they built a powerful and dangerous tool that I think many people still don\u2019t fully grasp.\n\nBeyond that, the book also does a great job capturing the relentless grind of working at Facebook during that era\u2014the long hours, the intense pressure, and how women were often forced to choose work over their personal lives, including caring for their newborns.

Him like he had frozen hips and knees, no muscle tone. Her like she had frozen shoulder and neck. Both wearing rictus grins and just having a hard time walking like normal people. \n\nResolved then and there, hitting the gym hard and continual stretching. No nursing home for me, gonna be climbing mountains. \n\nWork on your health and fitness, my punks!",

Well, the kitty in the first picture (biscuit) is under a year old and I saw her roaming about and hiding under my car everyday so I started to give her some food. One night, she started letting me pet her, so I decided to try to get her inside. I went upstairs to grab the cat carrier my mom left with me and some wet food to try to lure her into he carrier and take her upstairs. When I came back out, I saw another grey cat (maple) beside her. There are almost a dozen strays over here and never once have I saw this one before. She came up to me meowing like crazy and letting me pet her and eating the wet food. So naturally I put her in the cat carrier first and brought her upstairs and went ...",

They're basically making fun of her for having small breasts. \n\nWell the girl they were teasing went ahead called them bitches in response to the teasing. This led one of girls to pounce on the victim and start wailing on her right there in the shower. Messed her up pretty good too. I'm the female gym teachers. Heard the commotion and ran into there the shower and broke it up. \n\nAn ambulance had to recall for the girl that got bullied and beaten up. She has a concussion and a pretty beat up face. \n\nSo our disciplinary committee was called today and we decided that the two girls that were picking on the victim, but didn't assault her would receive 3 days of in-school suspension.

During that time, communication from the gym dried up. No one checked in, invites stopped coming, and when he asked about helping out at future events (in a non-climbing role), they politely said they were \u201crestructuring\u201d and didn\u2019t need him anymore.\n\nIt was a hard realization that what felt like friendship was more of a transaction, he was valued because he contributed, not because they genuinely cared.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean you should avoid making connections in places like gyms, hobby clubs, or even workplaces.
