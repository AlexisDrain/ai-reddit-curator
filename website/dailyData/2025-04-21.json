Because it means your thoughts alone can change your brain and body.\n\nWhen you constantly relive the stress of the past, your body believes it's still happening. It re-fires the same neural circuits, secretes the same chemicals, and you live in a loop - anchored to the familiar past. That\u2019s how your identity becomes a mere reflection of old emotions and stories.\n\nBut here\u2019s the alchemy: If you can emotionally condition your body to experience the elevated feelings of your desired future - gratitude, love, inspiration - before it happens, you begin to biologically live in that future. You literally signal new genes in new ways.\n\nThe body becomes the unconscious mind. And when you repeat this process enough, it starts to believe the new future has already happened.

"selftext": "**TL;DR** \\- Trump is using exorbitant tariffs to bankrupt as much of the American economy as possible so that his billionaire buddies can scoop it all up at fire sale prices using 1%-2% interest rate loans.  \n  \nThese headlines point to a very real problem brewing with the astronomical tariffs on China. The 145%-245% tariffs on Chinese goods are driving most businesses in the U.S. to cancel orders from China and existing Chinese freight inbound to the U.S. is at severe risk of being abandoned.

When I stop, he puts his nose down to my hand as if to ask \u201cwhy\u2019d you stop?\u201d\n\nHe\u2019ll also contort his body a really weird way. I\u2019ll post a picture in the comments, but he\u2019s sitting right next to me and will contort himself in half like a pretzel! Is he trying to face away from me?\n\nI need a little advice on this behavior because I\u2019m not really sure what he\u2019s wanting from me. Thanks!",

Overconsume once in a while and laugh about it. Share ideas of breaking out of the circle of working-consuming-working more. This is no puritanism contest of who is the saintest of the saint.\n\nEdit: And please don't ask if...",
