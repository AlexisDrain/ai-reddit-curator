"selftext": "\u201cThe United States imposed substantial new tariffs reaching up to 3,521 per cent on solar imports from select Southeast Asian nations, supporting local manufacturers whilst creating additional challenges for the country's renewable energy sector.\n\nThe tariffs, announced on Monday, follow a year-long trade investigation that concluded solar producers in Cambodia, Vietnam, Malaysia and Thailand received unfair government subsidies and exported products to the US below production costs. The inquiry, initiated under former President Joe Biden, was requested by American solar manufacturers.\u201d\n\nSource: https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-tariffs-news-live-updates-china-xi-jinping-us-stock-market-canada-india-uk-import-taxes-harvard-university/amp_liveblog/120462807.cms\n\nPaywall: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-21/us-imposes-new-duties-on-solar-imports-from-southeast-asia?embedded-checkout=true\n",

He\u2019s not allowed to say \u201cKassadin\u201d anymore.\n\nNow, as a joke (which has spiraled wildly out of control), I said:\n\n\u201cIf you beat **CaptainAFK** in a 1v1 *while* playing Kassadin, you can say the word again for 24 hours.\u201d\n\nCue chaos. What was supposed to be a dumb throwaway comment has evolved into a full-scale **event** happening tonight.\n\nHere are the cursed rules:\n\n* VoidBoy must play Kassadin. No switching. This is his burden.\n* He gets to ban 3 champs CaptainAFK can\u2019t use.\n* **No items allowed.** This is League of Legends: Raw Edition.\n* You can only recall if someone dies.

I can't stop thinking about it, and it brings a smile to my face when I'm feeling down. \n\nMy dad smoked a lot when I grew up. Like about 2 packs a day. When I learned about the dangers of smoking in school, I started to ask him to quit. He never listened, his addiction was just greater than all my begging, bickering and educating apparently.\n\nThen, at 17 years old, I started having health issues. It was while my parents were on a month long vacation without me (I forgot where to, but it doesn't really matter). It turned out I have ulcerative colitis - chronically inflamed intestines, so basically cramps and bleeding from the butt, as if periods weren't enough already. I basically went through this alone, since by bf back then was shitty support.\n\nSo anyway, I got an appointment super quickly, immediately had a diagnosis after a colonoscopy and some blood work was done and got on medication right away (thanks Eur...",

"selftext": "\u201cThe United States imposed substantial new tariffs reaching up to 3,521 per cent on solar imports from select Southeast Asian nations, supporting local manufacturers whilst creating additional challenges for the country's renewable energy sector.\n\nThe tariffs, announced on Monday, follow a year-long trade investigation that concluded solar producers in Cambodia, Vietnam, Malaysia and Thailand received unfair government subsidies and exported products to the US below production costs. The inquiry, initiated under former President Joe Biden, was requested by American solar manufacturers.\u201d\n\nSource:\u00a0[https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-tariffs-news-live-updates-china-xi-jinping-us-stock-market-canada-india-uk-import-taxes-harvard-university/amp\\_liveblog/120462807.cms](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-tariffs-news-live-updates-china-xi-jinping-us-stock-market-canada-india-uk-import-taxes-harvard-university/amp_liveblog/120462807.cms)\n\nPaywa...",

I was searching for ways to make it more exciting and keeping it new, while I perceived Anne as being satisfied with the status quo in the bedroom. We would have heavy discussions about sex and it generally made it a heavy and serious topic for us, not playful. \n\nWhat I realized through self reflection over the last few years was that I was too focused on what I perceived as \u201cmissing\u201d from our sex life rather than being grateful for what we had. We always had strong attraction toward each other, and although I have the higher libido, she enjoys sex. But I wanted more, and better, and different. And that got in the way of either of us being happy and satisfied with what we do have. \n\nSo about 6 months ago I made a conscious decision to stop striving and searching for a better sex life for us, and just to be patient and grateful and let it happen.

A restaurant or bar with a view to a beach is pleasant, but the stereotypical beach visit is genuine torture. \n\nI live in an area with a very 'loud' beach culture.  People here look at you weird if you don't like the beach. I truly do not believe people genuinely enjoy it. Could they be pretending to like it in order to keep up appearances? That is infinitely more plausible to me than the alternative.\n\nThis is my average beach experience: \n\n1. Pack everything. Towels, maybe beach chairs, a cooler if you're drinking.\n\n2. Drive over to the beach\n\n3. Walk across scorching hot sand which you can barely walk on because its so loose until you find the vague \"good spot\" to set up in...",
