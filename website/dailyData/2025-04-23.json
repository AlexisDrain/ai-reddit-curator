I went on strike and haven't touched it and finally broke today.\n\nToday I'm going out for live music and some reading at a local spot.

Scrubbed the orange slime away, and when I was done in the time I had it was STILL barely passable. It was sick. I can't believe I've been showerin...",

She spoke frequently and highly of her 35-year career in education.\n\nOne of my interview questions is about handling conflicts in the workplace. Her answer was that she never really had conflicts in the workplace. She said her job as a principal was to \"make sure the parents are happy first because when they're happy, the kids are happy and I'm happy.\"\n\nI couldn't roll my eyes hard enough. As annoying as that answer was, it was validation of my feelings towards school administration overall.",

We spent the night apart but ended up making up the next day and decided together to continue and try and communicate better.\n\nShortly after we made up though, I asked her if I could take a nap in the car while she did some driving toward our next destination. She said no problem. When I woke up, I noticed we were not going in the right direction. We were 15 mins from the airport and she told me she was returning the rental car and would be continuing the trip alone. I was dumbfounded by this as we had just had a heart to heart and decided to keep going on the trip. I couldn't believe she would do this while I was asleep next to her and not tell me until I woke up and asked what was going on.

This company, according to the Department of Justice, acted as a covert front for Russian influence operations, funneling nearly $10 million to prominent right-wing media personalities, including Pool, Benny Johnson, and Dave Rubin. The funds were reportedly used to amplify pro-Kremlin narratives and sow discord within the United States, particularly during the 2024 presidential election.\n\nThe indictment revealed that Tenet Media was established with the explicit purpose of recruiting American influencers to disseminate content aligned with Russian interests. Pool, known for his controversial commentary and significant online following, was among those who benefited from this operation. The financial arrangements reportedly included lucrative contracts, with some influencers allegedly receiving offers of up to $...",

I hated the idea, but I was young and scared that he really would harm himself, so I agr3ed, but only as a one-time thing.\n\nIt was not one time, but i suspect that you already knew that.\n\nThe second man raped me. He arrived at the house before my husband got home, and took advantage of my being alone in the house with my toddler napping in his bedroom, and he raped me.

But if your veins are tiny, hard to find, or moving around like they are trying to escape, I am already mentally preparing for a struggle.\n\nI always stay calm and professional on the outside, but inside, I am either celebrating or quietly panicking.\n\nSo yes, if you have ever wondered whether your nurse is silently evaluating your veins, the answer is absolutely yes.",

"selftext": "They've been together since they were in high school, and I'm convinced he never thought he could do better, so he just dealt with it. He became a doctor, and they have two kids, and she makes all the decisions about their care.\n\nShe doesn't want them to go to school because she doesn't trust what they teach them. She's homeschooling them even though she failed her teaching certification 3 times and gave up on that career. Their kids have no vaccines. When I asked my best friend why he admitted, he just didn't want to have the fight with his wife even though he's vaccinated and a professional in the medical field. I lost most of my respect for him.\n\nIt makes me really sad. We've known each other since middle school, and dude is a shell of that super intelligent ambitious guy he was. I told them I couldn't trust them to be godparents to my daughter since we fundamentally disagreed with how they are raising their kids. 20+ years of friendship is pretty much gone now.\n\nEdit for extra i...",

"selftext": "Why YSK: After seeing multiple posts about dog attacks and people in the comments giving absolutely terrible advice, you should know the only proven way to stop a dog attack is by oxygen deprivation.\n\nUsing a spare lead, pass the rope or cord under the attacking dog\u2019s neck, then pass it through the loop and cinch it tight like a noose. Hold it until the dog releases it\u2019s target either for air or until it passes out.\n\nDo not use your hands to try to pry the dog\u2019s mouth open. Do not try to make loud noises as it will likely heighten the attacking dog. Do not try to use your own body to attempt to subdue the dog whether by holding it down or trying to choke it yourself. For god sake don\u2019t stick your finger up it\u2019s butt. The only way is to force the dog to try to breathe by depriving it of oxygen.\n\nEdit: This is advice for a dog attacking another dog or animal. If you suspect a dog may attack you try get up high like on a car. If the attack is imminent, cross your arms against your ches...",

"selftext": "If you have no idea what I am talking about, there is a [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Weddingattireapproval/s/bjz5FLERtK) to my previous post. \n\nThe post has gotten a lot of attention over the night and I am glad people got a laugh out of it, because so did I and everyone else in the party. My insights say it has over a million views too! \n\nFor those of you who asked if it is a Dracula wedding, it is unfortunately not but me, the bride and almost every other guest lives somewhere in Transylvania lmao. Anyway, the bride has seen the cape and did not like it. After a lot of back and forth, the twin of the bride, aka the bridesmaid who wanted to wear the cape will no longer participate in the wedding, not even as a guest. \n\nThank you for your great insights!
