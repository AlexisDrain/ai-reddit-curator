If not the \"woke\" queers, it's the foreign hordes, or the lazy scroungers or the useless youth. \n\nWe're on the brink of a global recession, people can't afford to feed their families and the government isn't doing anything meaningful (taxing corporations and super wealthy) to deal with it. Climate change news is really dire and we seem to be rolling back on any progress that was made over the past 25 years. Ukraine is being abandoned and our special friend America now seems to be sucking up to Putin. \n\nIt's just absurd. Noone would give a fuck about trans people if the media wasn't whipping the issue up into a frenzy. \n\nThank you for coming to my talk.",

He made the decision to pass peacefully at home and the last thing he heard was the H3 Podcast playing in the background.\n\nI introduced him to H3 back during the Frenemies era, and from then on, he never missed an episode. It became his daily ritual, something that made him laugh, feel connected, and brought him so much joy. It meant everything to him.\n\nSince he passed, I\u2019ve kept playing every new episode. I still put it on every single day. And it\u2019s heartbreaking but it\u2019s also comforting. Because I still feel him here. \n\nThank you to Ethan, the crew, and everyone in this community. You brought happiness into his life, and now, even in grief, you bring comfort into mine.\n\nRest easy, Henry. I\u2019ll always keep H3 playing for you.\n\n",

"selftext": "So yesterday, I'm at the doctor's office filling out the paperwork that they ask you to do and there are several sections where you can add notes or explain. My printing is chicken scratch but my cursive is good so that's mostly what I use. Most of my forms have been online for the last 10 years. I finish filling it out, bring it up to the counter, take my seat, and wait to be called. The lovely young girl at the counter calls for me so I go back up to the counter and she proceeds to ask me what language I have written on my forms and that she can't read it. I tell her it's English in cursive and she says \"Oohkaaay, I never learned that kind of English but I've heard of it, I think they stopped teaching it in the early 2000s so you'll have to redo the paperwork.\" I politely declined saying 'I'm sorry to hear that you never learned it, but no thank you, I won't be redoing the paperwork, hopefully the doctor will be able to read it or I'm going to have to start my search all over agai...",

"selftext": "I live in a metropolitan city and the train I take home from work is crowded since everyone is also getting off work. There have been many occasions where other passengers on the train will occupy the empty seat next to them with their bag. There are people standing during the ride when there are available seats. \n\nI walked multiple cars to try to find an empty seat (without a bag) but couldn\u2019t. The last car I went to I asked this woman if I could sit there and she pretended to not hear me. I didn\u2019t want to tap her shoulder because you never know how people would react so I waved a bit to get her attention and she said she didn\u2019t want to hold her bag (which was a no). I told her I couldn\u2019t find any other empty seat and I had already walked the entire train and it\u2019s leaving soon. She ignored me again.

"selftext": "A couple weeks ago here on r/golf I stumbled upon a post by the new owner of The Paupack Hills golf course in PA. He was telling the story how he recently purchased the course and was bringing it back from the dead (closed for over a year)\u2026 \nI proposed to my now wife on the 6th hole there before they shut down and we thought we would never play it again. After replying how pumped we were to hear about the reopening, Greg J the owner mentioned us coming for our anniversary. I jokingly asked if he could get us out on the 19th (the weekend I proposed) before they reopen\u2026. He did!\nNot only did he invite us to come play before the opening, but he gave us his personal golf cart for the day since the club carts weren\u2019t in yet\u2026 Then he calls when we\u2019re on the 6th hole and tells us to wait a minute. The guy rolls up with champagne and glasses for us. Because nobody else is on the course, we were able to sit on the tee box, sip our bottle, and enjoy the view. \nGreg we can\u2019t thank you enough f...",

"title": "Why most Boys want Daughter??",
"selftext": "I\u2019ve asked over 50 guys friends, classmates and almost all of them said the same thing: \u201cI want my first child to be a daughter.\u201d\nNo hesitation. No second thought. Just\u2026 daughter.\n\nWhen I asked why, most couldn\u2019t really explain it.\nSome said, \u201cI want to treat her like a princess.\u201d\nOthers said, \u201cI just feel like I\u2019d be softer with a daughter.\u201d\nBut none of them had a deeply thought-out answer \u2014 and somehow, that made it even more real.\n\nIt\u2019s not about having a perfect little girl or dressing her in pink.\nIt\u2019s about the idea of raising someone with love, patience, and softness in a world that can be so harsh.\nIt\u2019s about giving her the kind of care and attention maybe we didn\u2019t always get growing up or that we saw the women in our lives miss out on.\n\nIt\u2019s wanting to be her safe place. Her biggest fan. Her first example of what love and respect look like.\n\nWe might not always have the words for it\u2026 but the feeling? It\u2019s deep.\nAnd honestly, kind of beautiful.\n",
