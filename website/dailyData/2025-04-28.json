Where is the Linux foundation (you know, the guys who maintain the kernel) located, the USA. So is Linux part american now? Can we no longer use it to \"own the yanks\"? NO.\n\nOpen-source means it's for everyone, the Linux ecosystem contributions from every corner of the globe so you can't either claim it as american or as european because it surpasses nations.\n\nThis also applies to whomever is maintaining the software. No, Fedora isn't american because Red Hat maintains it, it's still open source. No, Chromium itself isn't american because it was started by Google because Chromium is open-source. \n\nI know most of you...",

"selftext": "I've always seen a lot of discussion about the most impressive/iconic skylines, nighttime skylines, etc, but one thing I've always found underrated are skylines that have have an impactful \"reveal\".\n\nMy example - coming into Cincinnati from the south (I75/71).  You've been driving for a long time through a lot of greenery and countryside, and, at least before navigation was prevalent, you had an idea that you're getting somewhat close to the city.  Then you take a relatively sharp bank on the interstate and suddenly the best shot of the city is staring you in the face - bridges, skyline, stadiums, etc.  Not that Cincy cracks the top 20 skylines (maybe just within the US) for any well-traveled person - but it comes out of nowhere with its biggest and most striking angle.  Both of my kids got to experience it for the first time recently and it was a lot of \"whoa\"s coming from the back seat.\n\nI have a couple more that come to mind, but I'm curious what others think - what's your favorite?",

"selftext": "Last week, while cleaning out my childhood home to prepare it for sale, I found an old jewelry box tucked away behind a loose panel in my closet. Inside, there was a letter addressed to me in my mom\u2019s handwriting. She passed away 10 years ago.\n\nThe letter wasn\u2019t anything grand no secret confession or hidden treasure map. It was simple. She told me how proud she was of the person she knew I would become. She wrote about the little quirks she loved about me as a kid. She even made a few cheesy jokes, like she always did.\n\nReading it, I cried like I hadn't cried in years. It felt like she had reached across time just to hug me when I needed it most.\n\nLife has been overwhelming lately. I've felt so lost. But finding that letter\u2026 it was like she knew. Like she was still here, whispering, \"You've got this.\"\n\nI don\u2019t even care if nobody believes me I just needed to tell someone. Because today, I feel a little less alone.",

They made him get down at the Bhubaneswar railway station and ran away with his luggage and money.\n\nMy uncle spoke to his daughter after getting down and he seemed completely delusional and was talking gibberish. He explained that he met someone and was given some food.\n\nWe also saw him getting down the train and being robbed on cctv.\n\nHe seemed to have made his way to the Lingaraj Temple. But nowhere to be found there now. My cousins are searching there right now.\n\nHis phone is now switched off, has no money and is drugged.\n\nIf someone has seen my uncle or has any information, please DM me or call the phone numbers in the picture. Thank you very much.",

He retired from work a couple of years ago and this is what he loved doing. I think he\u2019d appreciate the reminder for everyone to be safe while out riding. \n\nHe was in his sixties, I don\u2019t know exactly when this pic is from but this was his passion.

My mom had been sick for all of three weeks before she died and my father was very clearly with these other women before that too. His wife knew he was married and she even knew that his wife was dying in the hospital and she chose to marry him a few months later anyway.\n\nI was so young at the time that it was traumatic going from a healthyish (mom had asthma) mom to a mom who had the flu and then pneumonia and was then gone in a three...",

"selftext": "Every time I see a TLOU video on TikTok, the comments are full of people saying Bella is \u201cthe wrong Ellie\u201d because they don\u2019t look exactly like the game version. But to me, it\u2019s so much deeper than that.\n\nAshley Johnson, who gave so much of herself to create Ellie in the games, plays Ellie\u2019s mom in the show and Bella actually resembles her in a really beautiful, full circle kind of way. I\u2019ve seen videos of Ashley acting behind the scenes, and you can feel how much heart and life she gave to Ellie. It\u2019s unreal and soo emotional.\n\nBella looking like they could actually be Ashley\u2019s child, feels so right to me. It makes the story feel even more connected, more meaningful. I honestly love it. I also don\u2019t see people complaining about other cast members not looking exactly like their game characters like Dina, for example, and it feels unfair that Bella gets singled out. \n ",
