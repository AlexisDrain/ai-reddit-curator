One of the toddlers was absolutely angelic, so charming that you couldn\u2019t help but be drawn to her.\n\nThey sat on the bench opposite me, even though there were plenty of empty benches nearby where the children could have been seated. What happened next truly shocked me. One of the women literally threw. Yes, threw the toddler onto the floor. I\u2019m not exaggerating. She used her leg to push the child off balance and made her sit on the floor, as if this was something she did all the time.\n\nAt first, I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt.

She was simply careless and cold.\n\nThe next thing I saw broke me: the toddler was chewing on her...",

Our oldest (17F) is a great student and always excited at the idea of going to college although, she did say she\u2019d like a gap year before going. Fine by me. As long as she got an education I don\u2019t mind that. However, now she says she doesn\u2019t want to go to college. I was surprised and disappointed. I asked her why she changed her mind like that. She said she had \u201cprivate\u201d reasons that she\u2019d prefer to keep to herself. I knew there was more to this than that. But if she won\u2019t tell me what can I do. I have picked up on something else. During a political discussion at the dinner table she said \u201cthe problems this country has are caused by its enemies. Like college professors.\u201d This garbage is spewed by far right talking heads and even the U.S. Vice President. This sort of thing from her surprised me and is worrying me. There is no doubt her believing this shit...",

Lists were used, civilians were given weapons, and state radio incited murder: \"Kill the cockroaches.\" Neighbors killed neighbors. Children, women, the elderly. Thousands of women were raped, many intentionally infected with HIV. Churches were turned into slaughterhouses. Schools into execution camps. The UN knew it. France, the US, Belgium\u2026 they all knew it. What did they do? Nothing. They withdrew. They refused to use the word \"genocide\" to avoid intervening. When it ended, it wasn't thanks to the world, but to a Tutsi rebel group led by Paul Kagame, who seized power by force. Today, he rules Rwanda. The country has changed\u2026 but the trauma lives on.

You don't know how to lose and behaved in a manner which is an embarrassment to you and the country you're supposed to represent.\"",

I hate the fact that protecting us only matters when the goal is to oppress trans women. \n\nWe only exist and have value if it\u2019s to insult others. They don\u2019t even listen to us and what we have to say. And when you ask them to provide exemples of situations where trans women are forcing lesbians to be attracted to them or whatever they\u2019re saying, you get downvoted to oblivion and of course you don\u2019t get any proofs. \nI don\u2019t want my sexuality to be used to oppress, insult or mock another part of the LGBTQ+ community. \n\nThis transphobic sub keeps popping everywhere on my homepage, I had to straight up block it.

It all started (arguably) with the Steam Wishlist rewards. They initially promised 10 pulls for hitting 100,000 wishlists, with a follow up \"surprise\" reward for hitting 200,000. **Instead, they retroactively changed the 100,000 reward to 2 PULLS, and made 200,000 10 pulls, completely removing the original surprise reward**. [Pic of before/after](https://imgur.com/a/Y5yK0PA).\n\n2. The community naturally lost their fucking minds, and after a day of rioting, Infold backed off and gave the 10 pulls + 10 additional pulls as a reward for hitting 200,000.\n\n3. People were already very unhappy with the longest patch so far (1.4) being the patch with the least amount of content, so this did little to appease the community. People are still smoldering.\n\n4.

I can confirm that he is indeed brash, opinionated and prone to going off on a bit of a rant sometimes. \n\nBut in my first few months of university in a foreign country, I saw that Andre was the first to welcome his fellow Singaporean juniors and provide a space for us to find community in each other by hosting us at his place. As a senior member of our faculty\u2019s law committee, he also took care of us as his fellow Singaporeans during the freshman events, where western sensibilities on alcohol consumption could sometimes prove a challenge for our local livers. When he was the senior mooting officer, he even took the time to give me feedback personally about my mooting style and spe...",

When he picked her up she immediately snuggled down in his arms and that was that.  \n\nMy 55 yr old badass biker husband was so worried about our foster cat, that he is asleep with her.  \n\n\nThis is why married him.  I look at him RN asleep with her and my heart melts.  ",
