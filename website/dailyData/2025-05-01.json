"title": "It\u2019s Time to Stop the 100x Image Generation Trend",
"selftext": "Dear r/ChatGPT community,\n\nLately, there\u2019s a growing trend of users generating the same AI image over and over\u2014sometimes 100 times or more\u2014just to prove that a model can\u2019t recreate the exact same image twice. Yes, we get it: AI image generation involves randomness, and results will vary. But this kind of repetitive prompting isn\u2019t a clever insight anymore\u2014it\u2019s just a trend that\u2019s quietly racking up a massive environmental cost.\n\nEach image generation uses roughly 0.010 kWh of electricity. Running a prompt 100 times burns through about 1 kWh\u2014that\u2019s enough to power a fridge for a full day or brew 20 cups of coffee. Multiply that by the hundreds or thousands of people doing it just to \u201cmake a point,\u201d and we\u2019re looking at a staggering amount of wasted energy for a conclusion we already understand.\n\nSo here\u2019s a simple ask: maybe it\u2019s time to let this trend go.

Salary was $180K with bonus. Cool, I\u2019m qualified, I\u2019ve done this for 10+ years. First couple of interviews go great. Then things start to spiral.\n\nThey ask me to create a \u201cbrief strategic review\u201d for one of their current product lines. Sure, fine. I spend 6 hours putting something together. They\u2019re impressed.\n\nNext week, they ask if I\u2019d be willing to join a \u201cstrategy workshop\u201d with their product team. It\u2019s just a \u201ccollaborative test.\u201d They position it like a chance to show off my thinking. It ends up being two full days of meetings, brainstorms, and even leading a mini presentation to their execs. I basically ran a free consulting session. They LOVED it. People from the team messaged me saying they hoped I\u2019d be hired.\n\nThen silence. For three weeks. I follow up nothing. Eventually I get a generic rejection email: \u201cWe\u2019ve decided...",

The reason I do this is because of the scarcity of tradesmen willing to travel out to the Isles for work, and the high demand for skilled work. It allows me to work a four day week, and still take home the same earnings as if I were doing 5 days on the mainland.\n\nRecently, I converted a 2 bed bungalow on one of these islands to a three bed. The house was for a young couple expecting their second child. They had grown up on the island.\n\nThey live on a street flanked by two Airbnb's. The house across from them is a second home.\n\nOrdinarily, it's not a complex thing to add small extension to a bungalow. But they had specifically asked me to divide an existing room instead. Why?\n\nBecause the 2 flanking Airbnb's were owned by the same person that owned the holiday home across the road. They had objected to the planning application.
