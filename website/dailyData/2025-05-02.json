She\u2019s made some great cakes in the past, and I wanted to support her, so I asked if she could make a cake for my mom\u2019s 60th birthday. I told her I wanted something floral and elegant, and I gave her some examples. I also told her clearly that my mom is allergic to almonds like, epi-pen level allergic.\n\nShe agreed, and I paid her a $100 deposit for the $250 cake. A week later, I went to pick it up and she was so proud of it. It looked beautiful, honestly, but when I asked what flavor it was, she told me it was almond vanilla, because she thought it gave it a \u201cmore upscale taste.\u201d\n\nI was shocked. I reminded her my mom is allergic to almonds, and she just kind of brushed it off and said it was such a small amount and it would be fine as long as my mom didn\u2019t eat too much. I told her I couldn\u2019t take the cake, and she got upset, saying I was being overdramatic and ungrateful for all her hard work.\n\n...",

But what they\u2019re enabling under Trump isn\u2019t a debate. It\u2019s a global threat, and the rest of the world sees it clearly.\n\nTrump has insulted allies, threatened to abandon NATO, and pulled the U.S. out of the Paris Climate Accord again. He has imposed tariffs on Canada and Germany out of spite, joked about annexing Canada, and treated diplomacy like a reality show. These are not policies. They are provocations, and they are shaking the global order.\n\nNow he has pulled back support for Ukraine, unraveling years of unity and leaving Europe to question whether the U.S. can still be trusted.\n\nRepublicans have already made clear they don't care how this affects people here. But they seem equally indifferent to the fact that it's dragging the rest of the world down with them. Their loyalty to Trump is wrecking alliances, stalling climate action, emb...",

He *HAD* to have known that if this thing was fake, it was going to be found. So I am left thinking that this is intentional, I guess.

She doesn\u2019t order anywhere nearby, she orders from the exact same place we do. \n\nThis is only the second time she\u2019s asked this week and the past 2 months. The In N Out part is because if she knows I\u2019ll be out of town she\u2019ll ask if I\u2019m willing to pick it up for her on my way back. I\u2019m always willing to because it\u2019s on the way and doesn\u2019t cost me anything other than 10-30 minutes in the drive thru.\n\nI understand it\u2019s not his mom and he has no obligation but I also don\u2019t see anything wrong with what my mom is doing. She\u2019s not pushy at all. It honestly breaks my heart to tell her no and that he just doesn\u2019t want to because it\u2019s her asking. \n",

The defense budget will fund the Golden Dome missile defense project, shipbuilding and nuclear modernization, border security among its top priorities. It includes a 3.8% military pay raise. Surpassing the $1 trillion mark in defense spending will likely cause sticker shock among US lawmakers who have criticized the Pentagon\u2019s repeated failure to produce financial statements that result in a clean audit. On Tuesday, the Government Accountability Office reported that the Defense Department disclosed about $10.8 billion in ...",

But the real kicker was Dave would pee in a bottle and if he was in a bad mood, that bottle would be thrown in someone's garden. If you tell him to throw the bottle in the trash, he'd throw it at you. Dave was the son of the postmaster (Bob), an older guy of the \"boys will be boys\" mind set, and best friends with the local Sherrif (Steve). If you talked to Bob about his son, it'd be excuses. He's a foster kid, he's had a hard life, and on and on. If you went to Steve then it'd be \"boys will be boys\" (Dave was in his 30s) or \"Postmaster Bob is dealing with it personally\".\n\nOne day in the middle of summer the neighborhood kids got to see Mailman Dave being his usual sunny self. Seems Dave was mean to them too. The kids were out playing with their water pistols and one of them had this real high-power thing which sent the water a good ...",

I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever build another one without him. He helped me with everything, whenever I had a question he was the buddy that would answer the phone in an instant or even come over to my crib and help out. Hurts so much man.

The Quematriz got it's tail torn off by Rey Dau and I guess that pissed it off enough to chase it across the desert back to it's lair. It ignored me the whole time and just kept fighting Rey Dau with me. I honestly needed the help cause the hunt was going horribly, and I carted twice in a row at the very start. It actually survived long enough to help me defeat Rey Dau. Afterwards it just peaced out.\n\n\nI have to respect Quematriz: it doesn't care about size or how outmatched it is, it is always ready to throw hands.",

Change feels slow sometimes, but moments like these really do show that progress is happening. I can say first hand that the leaders of both parties are the defacto leaders with very little others in the party having as much influence as they are.\n\nJust thought this forum would find this interesting.",

"selftext": "I remember growing up....  if after Junior High a kid or their parents elected for them to go to trade (or technical) school it was treated as if society gave up on that kid, and their parents failed \n\nAs if going to school to learn a trade or craft like Carpentry, Automotive Repair, Electrician work, or Plumbing was the lowest of the low in terms of outcomes for a young person. The fact that college was off the table meant \"they're going to become a crack smoking townie\" \n\nAs a person who went the traditional college route, it was definitely interesting to see that at 22 I was just starting off and saddled with debt. In that 4 years since high school these Trade School guys had become business owners, well paid contractors, and were (in a lot of cases) debt free and ahead of people with 4 year degrees just starting the rat race \n\nWe owe their parents an apology. Moreover we should be asking why our generation was so obsessed with the rat race. ",

Gonna get her some legit riding gear in the near future for possibly some longer rides. \n\nHad a slight issue in the end where the bike fell at the amboli ghats where we had stopped to drink water. We had our backs turned on the motorcycle and the road decided to cave in. The damage?\nMy knuckle guard was destroyed and my handlebar got bent. Rode almost 250+ with a bent handlebar. \nBut enjoyed the ride nonetheless.

The students that weren't speaking were writing what he wrote. Other students were at their stations. This was the we do portion, so I already taught the I do.
