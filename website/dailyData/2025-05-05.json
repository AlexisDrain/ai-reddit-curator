Ms. Feiner, known for her committed work with vulnerable community members, found herself at the center of a confrontation when security personnel intervened. The footage, which has since circulated widely online, shows Ms. Feiner being aggressively removed despite pleas from other attendees who urged that she be allowed to remain.\n\nOne onlooker described the scene as \u201ca blatant overreach of force, leaving no doubt about the intensity of the actions taken against her.\u201d The use of physical force against a social worker actively engaging in commun...",

"selftext": "Hey everyone! I just wanted to share an update because I\u2019ve officially hit my goal weight and I\u2019m feeling so proud and grateful for this community.\n\nI started at 230 lbs and I\u2019m now at 140 lbs. I\u2019m 5\u20196\u201d and this has been a long journey of consistency, patience, and learning what works for me. OMAD and intermittent fasting were absolute game changers.\n\nFor anyone wondering what I did:\n\nI kept things super simple. I basically eat the same thing every day and I don\u2019t get tired of it.\n\nMy typical OMAD meal includes protein, lots of veggies, and tons of fruit.\n\nI\u2019m obsessed with Greek yogurt and fruit. I use the frozen fruit in the bag and just let it thaw. It\u2019s my dessert every night and I still look forward to it.\n\nI also ate sardines straight out of the can almost every day. Great protein and so convenient.\n\nFor veggies, I stick to the microwave steam bags from the store. No prep, no mess, just quick and easy.\n\nI didn\u2019t overcomplicate things. I just focused on staying in my window, fu...",

After a volatile relationship marked by violence, Knight stabbed her partner, John Price, 37 times while he slept. The attack was so ferocious that many wounds penetrated vital organs.\n\nBut the horror didn\u2019t end there.\n\nKnight proceeded to skin Price\u2019s body, hanging the pelt from a meat hook in the living room. She then decapitated him and cooked parts of his body, preparing meals with baked vegetables.\nPlates were set on the table, each accompanied by a note bearing the name of one of Price\u2019s children, indicating her intention to serve them their father\u2019s remains.\nA third meal was found discarded in the backyard, suggesting she may have attempted to consume it herself.\n\nWhen Price failed to show up for work, concerned colleagues alerted the police. Upon arrival, officers discovered the macabre scene and found Knight unconscious from a self-administe...",

Can we shift to more constructive criticism around this show. Please? I have several issues with the it outside of casting. Wish we can discuss these problems somewhat respectfully in a safe space\n\nTLDR: This sub is turning into Bella Ramsey snark while we deserve a place to contribute meaningful thoughts to the discussion of TLOU show.
