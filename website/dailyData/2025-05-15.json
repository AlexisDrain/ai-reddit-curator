Wally splits his time while she works between sleeping in her office or staring out our front window. My wife was on a call upstairs, while Wally was looking out the window and she heard him go absolutely ballistic. Barking, growling, etc. He occasionally barks when we get a package but it\u2019s usually pretty minor. A few minutes later, the cops knock on our door. Apparently, someone robbed a couple other houses in the neighborhood and someone saw the robber pop the screen off our front window and tried to get in. Wally wasn\u2019t having it. Eventually the robber ran off. I am so thankful for him and it makes me feel more at ease that he\u2019s around while I\u2019m gone. Dogs really are the best. ",

"selftext": "So I was about 11 or 12 at the time and on vacation. We were staying at a lake in Alberta, and it was honestly a good time.\n\nI built an amazing sandcastle, it had walls, towers, and even a drawbridge made out of driftwood. Plus I built it on a platform made of rocks, halfway into the lake, like a little island. I mean come on, I even made decorative trees out of seaweed. Then the teenagers struck. This one kid went and kicked the sandcastle to bits, and even before I got a picture.\n\nMy next sandcastle, I buried the heaviest, most jagged rock in the base. The teenager went up to it and kicked it again. Let's just say, the castle lasted longer than his foot. My castles didn't get knocked down ever again.\n\nNow, as a teenager myself, I still vividly remember this event and it makes me laugh. Don't ruin people's work, kids.\n\nEDIT: By base, I meant like the bottom - middle of the castle, not under it.\n",

From day one, she had \"concerns\" about my communication style with clients. Mind you, I'd been praised by these same clients for being responsive and helpful.\n\nLast month, after I sent what I thought was a perfectly normal email to our biggest client about a small scheduling change, Debbie called an emergency meeting.\n\n\"From now on, I need to approve ALL client communications before they go out,\" she announced with that fake smile managers use when they're being unreasonable but pretending they're helping you. \"Everything.

That is its biggest down side.  But being paid to workout in the sunshine, meet influential and interesting people, and at a place where people want to be is special.  You\u2019re there to hangout with some guys for a few hours and have a great time.  \n\nI have a degree in electrical engineering and decided to put it in my back pocket for when I need it.

He mentioned that a couple of girls were flirting with him at the gym, but then I heard him say, I don\u2019t care about any of that I get to see my girl tonight. And then he just kept going: You don\u2019t get it. I\u2019m crazy about her. She\u2019s smart, sexy, so sweet, and I literally can\u2019t wait to see her.\n\nHe was just... gushing.

There is no leasing office in the building so it\u2019s only tenants. When I got the apartment, I supposedly got the last available room in the whole complex. Although whats strange is I\u2019ve never seen or heard of any other tenants in the building than the ones right across from me and to the right of my room.

"selftext": "Usual Kith'rak has CR of 12 in DND. Usual Supreme Commander has CR of 14. And there are a whole lot of both out there. \n\nVoss is **Jhe'stil Kith'rak**, the one and only, the greatest kith'rak in the empire, the living legend among Gith and second only to Vlaakith and maybe ch'r'ai. Maybe. The dude is so old he actually took part in Mother Gith's rebellion against illithids - just read his Silver Sword description. He is also among the smartest characters you meet in the game who was planning the new rebellion and Orpheus' return for thousands of years without any suspicion up until the moment Astral Prism was stolen. \n\nHe should be 15 level at the very least. Or an exception among githyanki whom Vlaakith doesn't soul-snack for the purpose of not weakening her empire by stripping it of such a valuable commander. There is just no fucking way in Hells he is that weak. He shouldn't be.\n\n\n\n",
