Like some frustrated level 2 druid who lost his spellbook. Then, as if realizing how stupid this looks, he just turns around and starts *running away*.\n\nNo teleport. No magic trick. Just *sprints*. I chased him down and finished him off. 1000 XP. Absolute legend.\n\nAnyway, shoutout to Larian for letting me slap Faer\u00fbn\u2019s most powerful wizard to...",

What makes you think they won't use your daughters any way they d--- please to make more babies?  Where do you think all this is heading?  Because I foresee rape gangs of Proud Boys making a sport out of procreating without the slightest responsibility.\n\nAnd now?  Now they are changing the SNAP and MEDICAID laws so that children won't be covered after the age of seven unless their parents are married.  Let that sink in.

"selftext": "I learned about this little gem recently, so thought I'd give it some love as it isn't talked about enough.  It's a short music video directed by Miyazaki for Chage &amp; Aska in 1995, and as far as I know, the only time Miyazaki did a sci-fi piece.  I would link the actual video but apparently that isn't allowed.  You can find it by searching for \"On Your Mark - Chage &amp; Aska video\".    \n  \nMakes me wonder what Bladerunner by Ghibli would look like.  ",

But in the back of my mind, I always knew there was something missing. I\u2019ve thought about her all the time over the last four years, as much as I tried not to. My daughter.
