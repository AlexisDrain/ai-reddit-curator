Our daughter is now 8 months old, and he just told me he\u2019s decided to go back to work, full time and that his mom will help watch the baby.\n\nI was stunned. That wasn\u2019t the deal. I sacrificed a lot physically and emotionally to have this baby, partly because I trusted him. I told him, during the argument, that I would never have agreed to this if I knew he\u2019d bail.\n\nNow he\u2019s calling me heartless and says I\u2019m using our daughter as leverage.

They are cast in things because they are good at the roll they play. While yes, new unknown actors are great a movie studio won\u2019t risk one of the franchises that actually earn them money on a no-name unless that no-name is insanely talented. At least you know that the performance will be solid, because these actors can actually play characters. I would rather see Pedro pascal in every franchise on earth then see Jesse Eissenburg (hopefully that\u2019s spelt right) or the rock play themselves for the 14th billion time in a movie, because the man can actually act. Why hate on good actors for doing there job?",

I was the last to arrive, and they had already gotten a table and were all drinking alcohol. When the waitress came up to me and asked what I wanted to drink, I couldn't have alcohol because of the medicine I'm on, so I ordered a Sprite. She gave me an awkward smile and said okay. \n\nTen minutes went by, and I still hadn't received my Sprite. However, she came back and asked my friends at the same table if they wanted another round. They all said yes, and then they ordered shots as well. I reminded her about my Sprite, and she nodded and left. She then brought all the alcohol and shots back out for my friends, but still no Sprite.\n\nAbout 10 to 20 minutes later, she returned and asked how we were doing.

I aim for at least 150grams of protein and most of my carbs are coming from vegetables and some fruit. \nCurrent routine is 4 day split which I've really been enjoying. For cardio I do at least 5 hours of brisk walking a week and 3 30 minute skipping sessions. \nRests days are when I feel my body needs it....maybe 1 a week. \n\nCurrent routine below. \nYou will notice I include my arm days with legs. I only just started doing this in the last month as I really want to grow my biceps and triceps so I've been making sure my arms are fresh and dedicating a solid amount of time to them rather than throwing in a few set after a hard chest or back day ( as I previously did). \n\n...",

Please.\n\nHere\u2019s the ground reality:\n\nThe average new IT grad here makes \u20b97 LPA (~$8,000/year).\n\nYet we\u2019re expected to perform at Google-level output, on that salary.\n\nTime zones, endless meetings, last-minute deadlines... we\u2019re dealing with it all too.\n\n\nWe\u2019re not machines. We care about the work. But mutual respect and realistic expectations matter. Timelines are important for both sides.\n\nSo instead of constant pressure, let\u2019s build partnerships. We\u2019re doing our best, and we know you want the best let\u2019s meet in the middle with some empathy.\n\nThanks for coming to my TED Talk.\n\n\nEdit : \nThe problem lies with the Indian manager.",

No I\u2019m not defending what he said. I made it very clear that was not okay and there won\u2019t be a second time for it. \n\nI handed him my phone with an auto loan calculator pulled up and told him to plug in some numbers, play around with it and see what we can afford.

She had constantly say, \u201cIf you\u2019re on time, you are late.\u201d She wanted everyone there at least 15 minutes early and unpaid, of course and would shame people who showed up just on time.\n\nI asked once if we had be paid for those extra 15 minutes, and she laughed like I told a joke. So I decided to comply. Maliciously.\n\nI started arriving 30 minutes early every day, clocking in exactly when I arrived. When she confronted me abt it, I told her I was just trying to be really prepared \u201cYou always say 15 minutes early is the bare minimum, right?\u201d\n\nShe tried to argue, but since I was hourly and our system logged every minute, payroll started paying me for all that early time. After a month, upper management noticed and asked her why overtime had increased for her team.\n\nShe backtracked so fast. Suddenly ON TIME was fine again.",

Eyes misty. Voice shaking. \u201cYes. Oh my God, yes.\u201d\n\nI froze. I panicked. I was not proposing. I was pretending.\n\nAnd I just\u2026 went with it. We\u2019re \u201cengaged\u201d now. Our families know. There\u2019s a group chat.\n\nI still haven\u2019t told her it wasn\u2019t real.\n\nTL;DR: Pretended to propose at Home Depot. She thought it was real. Said yes.

Recently, when they announced they're adopting a Bitcoin strategy similar to what MicroStrategy did, I had the chance to pitch the report idea to my editor. I mainly work in the crypto industry as a research analyst, so this crossover made perfect sense.\n\nThe report ended up being about 75 pages long.\n\nI covered who Ryan Cohen really is, his psychology, his leadership style, and why he's such a strong fit for a turnaround like this. I went through how GameStop has changed since 2010, why this leadership shift is actually working, and what fundamentals back it up.\n\nThere's a section on short interest, and the core focus of the report at the end focuses on GameStop's Bitcoin reserve strategy. I included some potential price scenarios using NAV premium models similar to what I previously did with MicroStrategy.\n\nI want to emphasize, this is a deep fundamental analysis of the company and its turnaround potential.\n\nI hope you will like it and I...",
