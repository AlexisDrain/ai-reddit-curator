This happened last week and since then we\u2019ve spent the week apart where he\u2019s pretty much not been talking to me at all. I\u2019ve been trying to respect his busy work and not bother him too much, although I\u2019ve tried to still show my love from afar by a small gift of these funny cat coasters to his house which went totally unacknowledged. So Sunday was the fight where he sent me away on an hour drive back to my place crying, Monday and Tuesday were radio silence of me trying to give him space. Wednesday onwards you can see from the screenshots. Honestly I know that I\u2019ve played a part in arguing and fighting but I feel like he\u2019s been so avoidant and uncooperative. I just feel so stupid now but I\u2019m finally accepting that breaking up is probably the best thing to do",

"selftext": "I'm finally able to reach my first million at 31. I started working as an email and chat support for my first job and was able to grind it out moving to different roles. It seems na you really need to go out of you comfort zone/ move places to increase your salary. \n\nI also did some income generating stuff on the side like reselling sneakers and taking easy tasks in upwork like doing product reviews/ game testing. Tipong maglalaro ka lang ng games na di pa nalalabas sa public, then magbibigay ka lang ng feedback and they will pay you. For sneaker reselling, you just need to join free raffles for hot pairs in local sneaker shops. Profitable pairs are usually Kobe's, Jordans etc\n\nIt takes time but there are definitely ways for you to earn extra depending on where you are good at or your interests. You just need need to research. Good luck! \n\nThanks for reading! I hope we continue reaching our goals :) I'm rooting for you",

"selftext": "We have all been there, you are at a group hangout, maybe a work event or a casual get together, and that one person just keeps throwing shade your way. Little jabs, sarcastic comments, trying to make you the punchline in front of others. The best move? Don\u2019t react. Don\u2019t argue. Don\u2019t even give it the attention they are clearly fishing for. Instead, stay cool. Stay polite. Laugh it off or change the subject. When you don\u2019t engage, two things usually happen: They get uncomfortable because the spotlight turns on them, not you and Everyone else starts to notice who\u2019s really being weird or rude. It\u2019s honestly one of the classiest power moves you can make, because while they are busy trying to look clever, you are showing confidence and control without saying a word. Let your calm silence say, You are not worth the energy.",
