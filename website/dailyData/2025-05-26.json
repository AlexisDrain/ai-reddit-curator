She said that would be great but it needs to be dairy free because her daughter stopped eating dairy.\n\nI know a great cake recipe with no dairy. I brought it to the dinner and it was a big hit. My friend asked for the recipe and I told her. When I got to the eggs her daughter became upset and ran upstairs.\n\nMy friend asked why I put eggs in the cake. I said the eggs were responsible for the spongy texture. She said the cake wasn't dairy free. I said it was. There is no milk or milk products in the cake, no cheese, no butter, etc...\n\nMy friend said eggs are dairy. I was confused. Dairy is milk and milk products to my understanding. She said dairy is anything that comes from an animal. I asked if honey is dairy then. She said no, because bees are insects. I apologized, but I could tell she was still upset.\n\nAm I the asshole? I've never heard of eggs being d...",

He pushed the washing machine out of the way and by doing so, shut and blocked off the door that stays open so they have litter box access. They were without access to their box for 24 hours between visits from our friend. We came home tonight to find this, and were hit in the face with the smell of urine. Our friend picked up the poop but didn\u2019t do anything about the pee. Frustrating but kinda don\u2019t blame him, it wasn\u2019t his fault. \n\nIt is in our maintenance request notes that we have cats and to be mindful of that. Of course, the housing office is closed tomorrow for Memorial Day, but I will be there right when they open at 7:30 on Tuesday to ~~raise hell~~ kindly ask that they replace this s...",

It was from a women saying that her and her husband wanted to pay me to go on an all expense paid trip with them, plus they would pay me an additional amount of money. I asked why they wanted me to do that, and was told that all I would have to do is look sexy and be eye candy for her husband. I was broke at the time so I gave it a thought. At first I thought it was a joke but then I told them that they had to pay me upfront and that I needed to make sure I would be safe. Eventually I felt like it was safe and the money they offered was really good. I went on the trip and was actually having a fun time, but then things started to cross some boundaries, and I regret that I let it go as far as I did. ",

Then he asked if he could come inside and have a look. I hesitated. Then his technician who was to connect the router also asked to have a look. I told them my apartment was messy. Then he said he jokingly said he will close his eyes and just have a quick peek. I said \"no, I don't feel comfortable having strangers in my apartment\". They said their goodbyes and I closed the door. My heart is racing for some reason, I do feel a little bad because that was my first time meeting the neighbour but I am glad I am finally learning to stand my ground. I still have had a hard time rejecting others. I am so proud of myself. I don't have to risk my safety to be polite. ",
