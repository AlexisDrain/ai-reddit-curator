I made a point of making each one original and creative, and not too short, at least a couple of paragraphs, with some detail about why I appreciated the thing the person had said or done.

It's definitely giving Olive Garden and Panera bread (before their revamp) stay-at-home socialite soccer mom vibes.

And yeah, f*** Israel and the entire West for supporting and creating this genocide and genocidal state. These people have changed history. They are at home in the hearts of millions, who believe in what they have stood up for.\n\nEffective activism has always meant doing things which were unpopular, against the norm in society and even against the law. It\u2019s meant being unafraid to be hated, and has virtually always eventually ended up being celebrated.\n\nLink to story: https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/12/10/watch-greta-thunberg-declares-f-israel-german-demonstration/",

Today we went about our normal routine and he seemed completely normal, and out of nowhere I hear him throwing up and defacating all over himself. As I got outside to check on him he started seizing and it was a genuinely scary sight as he is a 130 pound German shepherd and I\u2019ve had previous dogs bite and not recognize me after seizing. We took him to the vet immediately and were told his heart rate was extremely elevated and it seemed he had anaphylaxis, he then started expelling bloody stool while we were there and things took a steep decline. We sadly had to decide to put him down because we needed a plasma transfusion since his blood wasn\u2019t clotting. We were quoted 11k for all treatments and that\u2019s just not something we can afford and sadly we had to put him down. I just want to ask and see how to prevent this in the future I just feel so horrible for my boy :(",
