I\u2019m pretty easy to get along with, but I despise cheating and lying more than anything. I ran my quiz through ChatGPT and told it to generate as many different versions as possible where the questions are in the same order but the multiple choice options are ordered differently each time. \n\nI labeled each quiz \u201cForm B.\u201d The look of absolute confusion when the cheaters failed miserably while the few students who tried it on their own got decent grades was fun to see.

The men in white mask came over to him and quietly began removing the rope that was holding the baby. This is when I saw the baby was dead. \n\nThe men held him by the arms and feet and placed him on the fire. The boy stood there without moving , watching the flames. He was biting his lower lip so hard that it shone with blood. The flames burnt low like the sun was going down. The boy turned around and walked silently away\".",

A few things have been going on, and I\u2019d love to share a bit of what\u2019s behind the slowdown.\n\nSince the end of April, I\u2019ve been on tour across Europe. It\u2019s been incredible, but also pretty non-stop. We only get a couple days in each city, and time has just been disappearing.\n\nMost importantly, my wife, who many of you know is in the middle of cancer treatment, has been able to join me for part of this tour. That time together has meant the world to me, and I\u2019ve really tried to be present and soak it in while we\u2019re out here.\n\nAlso, I do all the editing for my clips myself, and we only recently figured out a workflow that lets me get footage quickly and cut things on the go. It\u2019s taken a while to get here.\n\nAnd for anyone wondering, I am sitting on A TON of footage. We had a long stretch where I wasn\u2019t getting any footage at all, but we finally got it all a few m...",

Being strong, making sure my kids know that it's okay to feel upset, and making sure they get the 2 on 1 parent treatment so nothing feels watered down.  Once everyone had been tended to, I asked for a few minutes alone.\n\nBeneath the oak that she spent so much time...",

We were fighting at that time. I have no idea what to think. Is this cheating? My whole family is moving away from me in 4 days. Im alone. He\u2019s said if we split he\u2019s making sure he gets our son. And our son is my literally last thing keeping me afloat. I\u2019m spiraling cause we were starting to save for a house next year. We\u2019ve talked about marriage. We\u2019re SUPPOSED to have a future. So was that all lies? Was I just quick sex and then he couldn\u2019t leave after our son? Is there even any actual love to him. I can\u2019t even think straight. I\u2019m so. it\u2019s making me lose my mind to think another girl could\u2019ve been in our home, in our bed, touching my son. I\u2019m furious and feel blinded. But there\u2019s no new messages since March on text atleast. ",

These roles aren't just jobs, they involve launching satellites, designing missile systems, developing indigenous technology, a single error can cost millions, or worse, lives.\n\nSimilarly, in fields like engineering and medicine, where real-world outcomes matter, a doctor's mistake or an engineer\u2019s miscalculation can be catastrophic. Shouldn\u2019t merit be the only metric for entry and advancement in such critical areas?\n\nReservation in education and general employment might serve a purpose, but should it apply across the board, especially in institutions and sectors...",

He smirked and said, \u201cIt\u2019s just a mug.\u201d\n\nSo I made it his.\n\nOver the weekend, I smeared a thin layer of canned cat food under the rim and let it sit sealed in a bag. On Monday, I left it out clean and dry.\n\nHe took the bait.\n\nBy mid-morning, people were asking what the hell that smell was. Mark looked nauseous. Someone said it smelled like a corpse microwaved in fish oil. He dumped the mug in the sink and left early.\n\nI didn\u2019t say a word. But I did start a quiet conversation later about how gross it is when people use each other\u2019s stuff.\n\nHe\u2019s been drinking from paper cups ever since. People still avoid the breakroom when he\u2019s in it.\n\nThe mug\u2019s back on my desk now. Still smells like victory",

"selftext": "This picture always makes me laugh, what a sight: Valtteri Bottas, sitting alone on a public bench in Montreal, still in his biking gear, just enjoying a beer.\n\nTwo years ago on June 14 2023, Bottas organized a public bike ride in Montreal on the Wednesday before the Canadian GP. Around 100 cyclists joined him for a casual ride around the city. The ride wrapped up at a park next to a local microbrewery that sponsored the event (Siboire) and provided some post-ride beers.\n\nTrue to form, Bottas enjoyed his beer quietly, all by himself on a bench. He was super chill, signed a few autographsti and took a few selfies with fans. Everyone there was really respectful. The whole event was low-key and not heavily promoted, which probably helped keep the crowd to a manageable size.\n\nAll in all, a very cool experience.",

"selftext": "I\u2019m 22, just graduated from college a few months ago. While my classmates were polishing r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and stressing over interviews, my parents sat me down and made it clear: I wouldn\u2019t be job hunting. I\u2019d be working for them.\n\nThey run a massive waste management company like, city-wide contracts, fleet of trucks, recycling centers, the whole deal. It\u2019s their legacy, and they want me to take over someday. But they also made it clear I wouldn\u2019t be jumping into some cushy office role with a fancy title. If I was going to lead the company, I had to understand it from the ground up.\n\nFair enough. I actually respected that.\n\nSo I started at the very bottom. One day I was on a truck hauling trash bins in the rain, the next I was elbow-deep in recyclables at the sorting center. I never told anyone who I was.
