Our mutual friend introduced me a someone with over 10 years experience. I had recently completed a masters degree and was the only woman and the only person under 40 on a panel discussion at the conference. I extended my hand to shake his and he turned away and sneered that he had more experience than I had years alive. I'd never met him before and have no idea why he held such animosity against me. \n\nFast forward 15 years. I have a job in a large agency that hires contractors to complete some of our objectives that we lack capacity to do internally. He's been considered on several contracts, and I've told the story of his arrogance and how i won't work with him. He didn't get those contracts. He likely has no idea and maybe he wouldn't care. Still feels good. \n\n",

It\u2019s already been made which is the worst part. So use it as best you can to make something you can use for a decade. \n\nThe deed is done. You own something that is not ecofriedly.

I hadn\u2019t spoken to a lawyer, yet I was planning my exit.\n\nThen, in October, Adam was diagnosed with stage 2 cancer which has progressed quickly to stage 4.\n\nI didn\u2019t leave. I couldn\u2019t. How do you walk away from someone who just found out they\u2019re dying?\n\nSo, I stayed. I shifted to caregiver, and I\u2019ve played the part well. Everyone calls me \u201camazing\u201d and \u201cso strong.\u201d I cook for him, I take him to treatments, attend all the doctors\u2019 appointments. I will call the emergency services as needed. I tell him I love him.\n\nBut deep down\u2026 I checked out a long time ago. And the guilt is crushing.\n\nI\u2019m not staying out of love \u2014 I\u2019m staying because anything else would make me a villain in everyone\u2019s eyes, especially because he would end up uninsured.
