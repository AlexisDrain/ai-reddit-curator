"selftext": "I went travelling in Asia for 9 months, and every airport security I have asked them to hand search my camera as I don\u2019t want the film to get damaged. \n\nAt my last airport, which is in Amsterdam transfer, I kindly ask the\nLady at the X-ray machine to hand search my camera. She laughs at me and says no and puts it in the tray. Starts telling me that the film in the camera is no different than my camera roll on my phone. Which is clearly not the same thing at all. I have made it through countless airports without the camera going through an x ray machine but the very last one :( \n\nShe then proceeded to keep laughing at me and telling me I\u2019m not a professional, which I never claimed to be. I just didn\u2019t want my film to be damaged by the X ray machine.\n\nI proceed to walk through the machine and then she shows her colleagues the camera and laughs and chucks it back into the tray.",

I needed to do other stuff so I opened Chatgpt put it on chat introduced it to my son and then gave the phone to my son and told him to tell the computer all about Thomas and friends. After about 2 hours I went looking for my phone so I could text a friend and found my son STILL talking to Chatgpt about thomas the tank engine. The transcript is over 10k words long. My son thinks Chatgpt is the coolest train loving person in the world. The bar is set so high now I am never going to be able to compete with that. ",

The place had three bedrooms: one master with an en suite, one decent-sized room, and one smaller room with bunk beds.\n\nI booked the Airbnb, coordinated the whole trip, handled the deposit, etc. Naturally, I claimed the master - I didn\u2019t assign rooms to everyone, but I said upfront I\u2019d be taking that one for the effort I put in. No one objected.\n\nTwo of my friends, a couple, arrived at the house before I did (I had to work that morning), and when I got there, they'd moved their stuff into the master.

We took her to the vet immediately and they said we had to either put her to sleep or pay 3000$ for her intensive care, which only had a 50% of survival as she was bleeding from her lungs. We decided to let her go as we couldn't afford it. I was so sad, I can't stop crying. It's been around 2 hours since I last saw her. She was just a baby. The veterans were kind enough to let me pet her before and after they put her to sleep. I sat with her for 15 minutes I think before I had to finally say goodbye and leave her. I kept her collar. I'm crying as I type this because she was my everything. There's no one to jump on me in the mornings anymore, no one to try and open the door when I'm in the bathroom, and no ...",

I was admitted not too long after my original post after experiencing some incredibly intense pain. \n\nSurgery hasn't worked how we hoped, the trial combination chemo hasn't worked as we hoped, and I am far too sick to even attempt it again. \n\nThe reality of the cancer growth, my own health, and ability to fight back, on top of other mitigating factors. It's now come to a point of just making myself comfortable. \n\nWhen I first posted about my Steamdeck, I was wanting to play games for nostalgia, games I had missed, but with a change in the wind, so does my priorities. \n\nSo, I ask, \n\nWhat games should I play before I die? \n\nPlease think deeply on ...",

Rather, he\u2019s a social worker simply doing his job, genuinely wanting what\u2019s best for Lilo.\n\nRodrick Heffley (Diary of a Wimpy Kid) \u2013 While he often acts like a huge jerk and constantly bullies Greg, Rodrick is just your typical teenage delinquent and older sibling. Despite his teasing, he does care about Greg and helps him out of trouble on multiple occasions\u2014though it\u2019s often trouble he got Greg into in the first place.\n\nThe Old Miner (A Minecraft Movie) \u2013 All he did was yell at both young and old Steve to leave the area because they were trespassing and the mine was extremely dangerous. He was simply doing his job and trying to keep trespassers out for their own safety. ",

I threw my car in park, turned on my hazards, and jumped out of my car to pick it up.\n\nIt was in very bad shape so we rushed it to the closest vet. We surrendered our \u201cownership\u201d of him so that the vets could take care of him and nurse him back to health, then what followed was my family and I tracking him non stop as he bounced from vet to foster home to foster home. When he was finally old enough to adopt, we got him.\n\nMr. Charlie is glued to my hip.

Just odds and ends from here.\n\nAnyways, if anyone's going to Goodsprings in November, I'll be there for all three days! Thanks for looking.",

"selftext": "I work part time doing excavating for a local company while attending school, and one of the things I appreciate is that everyone, including me, gets weekends off. The pay isn't great at about $18.50 an hour, but it's not terrible considering the hours are flexible enough to fit around my class schedule.\n\nRecently, the owner, who spends his weekends at his multimillion dollar cabin, asked me to go fix a broken excavator. I'm barely qualified to do mechanical repairs, and it's frustrating because his nephew, who is the actual equipment mechanic and makes nearly twice as much as the rest of us, wasn't asked to handle it. I feel like I'm being put in an unfair position, expected to take on responsibilities outside my skill set and pay rate just because it's convenient for him.",

"selftext": "In the early 90s, we bought a new house on a lot that was recently severed and sold from the neighbor's property. It was a latge corner lot, divided into two parcels. The back parcel was originally intended as a second driveway to connect the side road to the neighbor's, but was mistakenly sold to us.\n\nOur neighbor, a known grumpy old guy, insisted that this back parcel was his property and was never intended to be sold (he and his lawyer messed up). He would often stand there, right in front of our bedroom windows to kinda mark his property! Trying to have a reasonable conversation with him was impossible. I repeatedly told him that I had the deed and that the property line wasn't going to change. \n\nHis wife was rarely seen as she had limited mobility and spent most of her time watching TV connected to a C-band satellite dish. At the time, I was working in wireless and had access to test equipment. To find a way to keep the neighbor occupied and hopefully give us some peace, I deci...",

So I brought her in, bathed her to get rid of fleas, and took her to the vet. \n\nThe vet said she had fading kitten syndrome, and likely wouldn't make it through the night. I had her for six days. Luckily, this coincided with some time I had off of work. \n\nThe first two were spent feeding every 10 minutes, around the clock. I did not eat or sleep until day 3 when she had her first poop, and I allowed myself my first nap. Over the next few days she kept improving. I still checked her constantly, kept her warm under a heat lamp, fed her, gave her medicine, cleaned the pus out of her eyes and her butt after she pooped. \n\nAt first she was in a small box, and her water bowl was a tiny lid, to minimize the risk of her falling in and getting wet or drowning. As she improved, she moved around and played more and more, I got her a ...",

Don\u2019t lie to me. I need help finding a charging cable for my son\u2019s iPad.\u201d\n\nAgain, I politely told her I was not an employee, just shopping. She went off.\n\n\u201cYou young people have no work ethic. If you\u2019re too lazy to help customers, you shouldn\u2019t work retail!\u201d\n\nI laughed a little and walked away, thinking it was over.\n\nTen minutes later, I was in line to check out, and this woman appeared behind me\u2026 with a cart full of stuff.\n\nShe tapped me on the shoulder and said, \u201cIf you\u2019re not going to help me, the least you can do is use your employee discount.\u201d\n\nI blinked and replied, \u201cMa\u2019am, I don\u2019t work here.
