I'm not exactly an expert on this but given that the last one was 8 months ago its a good sign! \n\nTHEN THE BIG ONE! Team Cherry added 10 achievement languages while I assume means the game is ready for launch \ud83d\ude0a \n\nFinally some numbers changed, maybe a release date or price that will be revealed later! \n\nThis was your Steam update update direct from someone who spent way too long trying to find something original and mew and wrote a whole post about something from 8 months ago before realizing \ud83d\udc94\n",

"selftext": "On June 10th 2019 I finally admitted to my wife that I was a gambling addict and had a considerable amount of debt to my name. She did not leave me. She supported me.\n\nToday 3rd June 2025 I am pleased to say I have been gamble free for 6 years. My last bet was placed on the 3rd June 2019.\n\nI am still not debt free but there is light at the end of tunnel. I should be all being well debt free next May. \n\nMy wife and friends and family have always been there to support me and they did not react to the news in the way I thought they might. \n\nIf anyone else is struggling and wants help. Please talk to someone. If you can't speak to friends and family speak to someone. \n\nIf you need financial support speak to Stepchange the debt charity. \n\nAnd if you are struggling with gambling then install Gamstop and reach out to Gamcare for help. \n\nHopefully this post post might help someone else in a similar situation to me.

Fortunately she didn't get any serious injuries, but I wud have lost her that day, n that haunts me till date.

He's always been hard to work for, but he actually told me to get over it because her death was creating extra work for him. That was the straw and this camel's back broke. I can't quit my job, but I'm taking steps to move to a better role and I know I need to keep the peace until then.\n\nI always start emails with a positive first sentence. Something like a simple Good morning! or I hope you're having a nice day! I still do this on emails to my boss, but I have omitted exclamation points entirely. I've been here over a decade so it's extremely noticeable to anyone who works with me closely and it's driving him crazy. His messages seem frazzled and he's frantically using exclamation points in every email, something he has never done before.\n\nIt's so stupid but I can tell it's breaking him.",

He was shot and killed by a neighbor after an argument escalated. He married his husband in February, and his husband said the neighbor who killed him didn\u2019t approve of their relationship. \n\nAlso note: the amount of media that reports Tristan as a partner when Tristan uses the term husband. Don\u2019t disrespect their commitment. \n\nI\u2019m crushed and furious. \n\nThis lesbian is holding him in memory and ready to rage. ",

Now we have a group pickle jar in the break room labeled \u201cFor morale purposes only.\u201d\n\nHR hasn\u2019t said anything. In fact, I saw our supervisor munching on a pickle during a budget meeting like it was a stress ball. One guy even started making TikToks rating different brands.\n\nI used to dread my 9\u20135. Now I look forward to seeing what kind of pickles show up next. Who knew emotional support brine was the key to workplace happiness?",

I wanted the silhouette of the skirt to resemble wings, so that was an easy accomplishment.  I tried to create gathers along the medial edge of the front right panel but the paint changed the drape so I ended up pleating it instead (with mediocre results).

I\u2019m polite, I help out during holidays, I\u2019ve organized birthdays and anniversaries for her even when I was 8 months pregnant. She never says thank you, only criticizes.\n\nMy husband?
