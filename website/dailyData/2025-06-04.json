Apparently at the beginning of every summer they hold a BBQ to welcome the new interns and give them a chance to get to know everyone outside of work. The BBQ was held at my bosses house and about 25 people were expected to come. My boss had set up a volleyball net and after everyone was finished eating, people started teaming up and heading over to play.\n\nOne of my coworkers asked me to join their team, but I politely declined. I explained that I have a disability and couldn't play. I didn't explain much further because the disability that I have is an extremely rare genetic disorder that is difficult to explain, so I usually just keep it pretty bare-minimum. If people want to ask about it, they always do.\n\nWell, one of my other coworkers is disabled and uses a wheelchair.

He is only requiring about 35-40% FiO2 his vent settings are pretty much the same with some adjustments to account for weight. He is off of the sedation drips (still on methadone and Valium to help with withdrawals).  His steroids are down to once a day from twice a day and they are going to try to wean him down to his maintenance dose this coming week.\n\nDue to Bentley doing well this past week, the team has decided to order his home ventilator. What this means is that they will begin trialing him with the home ventilator.  While it seems like we are on the back end of this and could be going home soon, that was our first thoughts, the doctors have assured us it will take a significant amount of time for him to fully tran...",

It's deeply rooted in our culture, and there's no denying the joy it brings to millions. But in a country of 1.4 billion people, shouldn't there be room for *more*?\n\nIndia is home to incredibly talented athletes in sports like hockey, wrestling, boxing, athletics, kabaddi, shooting, and even chess. These athletes bring home medals, break records, and often do it with far less support, funding, or recognition. Still, they fight on, driven purely by passion and pride.\n\nThe problem isn't cricket\u2014it's the imbalance. The media, brands, and audience attention are so focused on one sport that others barely get noticed. Our national sport, hockey, rarely trends. A gold medal in wrestling or a world record in athletics gets a few claps, while a six in IPL creates nationwide headlines.\n\nWe\u2019re not asking to replace cricket. We\u2019re just asking to *share the spotlight*. Let's cheer louder...",

I've played pokemon since it came out in the states, I was about 8 years old, and have lost the bulk of my collection over yhe years but always have tried to get a few packs from every set just to kind of keep on. \n\nFor Christmas my husband surprised me with a booster box of Stellar Crown. He knows nothing about Pok\u00e9mon, so the fact he got it for me meant so much more. It was the first and last bit of cards I'd find until a few weeks ago. At a small comic con I grabbed a few Journey together packs at close to cost, it was one of my first cons I was working at since treatment ended. \n\nToday, though, was my check to see if treatment worked. The radiation keeps working for 3-4 months after you're done with horrible side effects but it is what it is, you know? The doctor said I had a complete positive respon...",

So she started her drop year and studied diligently. Sometimes i used to take her on date to hangout at my mid tier gfti college. This year she got 99.5 percentile in mains and she told me her mains went \"sahi\" and i thought she'll get around 5k and boom it was under 2k, i wqs surprised. Now its party time\ud83e\udd73",
