I have a good job, no kids, I save my money. My younger brother (31M) and his wife (29F) have 3 kids and are constantly broke. My mom says it's \u201cjust a phase,\u201d but it\u2019s been like this for years.\n\nEvery summer we do this family vacation to the beach, usually a rental house that we all split. Except I always end up covering more than my share. Last year, my brother said he couldn\u2019t afford his part until \u201cafter the trip,\u201d and surprise surprise, he never paid me back. I also paid for the groceries, gas, and even his kids\u2019 amusement park tickets because \u201cthey didn\u2019t wanna feel left out.\u201d My mom said I was being selfish when I brought it up.\n\nSo this year, when the group chat started planning again, I said I\u2019m out. I told them I\u2019m not going, and if they can\u2019t afford the trip without me footing half the bill, maybe they shouldn\u2019t go either.\n\nNow everyone\u2019s piss...",

It's deeply alarming how the supporters of the Davao man have brought such noise and disruption to The Hague, turning a once peaceful city into a stage for their blind devotion. Nakakahiya talaga. Their actions aren\u2019t just loud, they're insensitive to the residents who live there. Imagine being surrounded by chants and slogans defending someone accused of letting thousands die without trial or mercy. This isn\u2019t just about politics anymore, it\u2019s about basic decency and respect for others. Protest if you must, but do it with dignity and truth. Don\u2019t trample on the peace of people who had nothing to do with our country\u2019s mess.\n",

My wife had the babies last month, they're both healthy, and we're both exhausted. \n\nThe names we ultimately chose are Sebastian Jacob and Juliet Elizabeth, inspired by Sebastian from Twelfth Night and Juliet from Romeo and Juliet, as well as Jacob and Elizabeth from the Jacobean and Elizabethan eras of theatre, when Shakespeare wrote. A big thank you to the person who suggested that; my wife loved it. \n\nWe had the twins at home for a few weeks before we named them. My wife was finally able to see them as our children, rather than extensions of herself to advertise her hobbies, hence the separate but still Shakespeare-themed names, which hopefully won't be too obvious. \n\nMy wife\u2019s best friend will be their godmother, as a thank-you for her support and reality checks throughout everything. And finally, a big thank you to everyone here for your name suggestions and advice. It helped more ...",

He\u2019s honestly been the best boyfriend I\u2019ve ever had but the only problem is that he\u2019s supper jealous. When we first started dating I thought I would be able to change it by showing him that I would not cheat on him like his past and didn\u2019t need to worry about what I would do to him. I\u2019ve tried my absolute best to reassure him in his worries and I even deleted all my social media. Agreed to stop talking to certain friends and even the male gender in general all for him. Now after 2 years of up and down I\u2019m started to wonder if he\u2019s ever going to see me for me. For example this morning he awake before me ( on FaceTime) and said that while I was sleeping my shirt had rode up and that my boobies were exposed. When I woke up he told me this like I somehow did it on purpose and was upset at the fact that it happened. Again I explained I had no idea a...",

Abby was upset because she felt left out and I felt bad for her so I decided we'd have a day out.\n\nOn Saturday we went to Cheesecake Factory (our favorite restaurant), a local spa, and I let her have a mini shopping spree at the mall that only came out to about $150. I paid for it all since I got a hefty bonus and didn't know what else to spend it on. She felt better after and we even had a heartfelt mother-daughter moment at Build-A-Bear where we made each other bears. We also had brunch on Sunday although it wasn't very costly.\n\nThe boys came home last night and Abby was excited to tell Josh all about what we did over the weekend. He got mad and c...",

I once warned a mom about what a bad influence Andrew Tate could be, and the dad came back at me hard, saying I don't know what I'm talking about. I'm at a loss. Do you just leave them be?\n\nEdit:\nTo some comments: I do not preach my politics to my students. I make it a point to not show where I lean, even when talking about politics in Social Studies. I brought up the concern up with a parent, not directly to the student. The only thing I push is to be respectful to others. I would also be concerned and address misandry if observed. \n\nApparently telling a parent that a disrespectful person is influencing their child to be disrespectful, is political. My bad. ",
