"selftext": "My mom died when I (22f) was 10 and in her will she left me an inheritance of more than 100k. My dad was left in charge of it but after he remarried, him and his wife wanted to start a business together and they used the money mom left me to open it. Dad and I argued about it at the time but I was 15 and he kept insisting it was good for the whole family and how it was better used to help everyone than being thrown away on random shit when I turned 18.\n\nOur relationship was over before I moved out of his house at 18. I had made his and his wife's life miserable for stealing from me and once I was out of there I looked into how I could get that money back. I pressed charges against him for stealing from me and I sued him for the money. I had the support of my entire extended family on my maternal side and some on my paternal side. But I was told by others on the paternal side to consider my dad's other kids and the devastation that kind if financial upheaval could bring. I ignored th...",

Cool, right?\n\nWell\u2026not for long.\n\nShortly after, another panelist replies to that email CC\u2019ing everyone, including me (the applicant) and says:\n\n\u201cBart is out. Lisa is not the authority on this matter. Cancel the request to Bart and apologize.\u201d\n\n\u2026and yes, Lisa is the one who actually seemed to like me during the interview. And she was also cc\u2019d in this email, telling her that her opinion didn\u2019t matter. So I guess I got the boot and a live show of their messy internal drama.\n\nI knew some people in the panel had reservations, but this? Come on. If your team can\u2019t even handle email coordination or basic professionalism in a hiring process why would I want to work there?\n\nNot sure if I should hit them with a polite \u201cthanks for the...",

This took place around December 1992-January 1993.*\n\nI got a job as a security guard after leaving the Army, because I wasn't qualified to do much else, and I hadn't decided if I was going to college yet or not. The company refused to pay very much so they had high turnover. Because of the turnover, they had small raises built in at 90 days, six months and a year as an incentive to stay on. \n\nI needed a job, and until I had my shit together, this would do. So I showed up and worked. My one year anniversary rolls around and I don't see my 50 cents an hour raise in my paycheck, but something more like 35 cents. So I called the boss. My three and sixth month raises had been delivered with no issues, so I was surprised my one year anniversary hadn't shown up.\n\nSupposedly they wanted to give all employees a raise, so they did.

He\u2019s not.\n\nLater, when shown how to clock in, he says, That sounds like micromanagement. Then proceeds to ignore every instruction and wander off to get a feel for the office vibe.\n\nBy lunch, HR had a chat with him. By 3 p.m., his keycard didn\u2019t work anymore.\n\nBlink and you missed it truly a short but memorable season of Chad.",
