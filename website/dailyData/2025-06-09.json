Now my husband thinks I overreacted because \"she didn't mean harm\" and \"just has old-fashioned views.\"\n\nAIO for setting this boundary? I see this as my child's first experience with racial microaggressions, while my husband thinks I'm making it a bigger deal than it is.

And losing interest in the game world makes me question why I should care about getting clothes in that world.\n\nPhotos are entertaining only for a few hours after obtaining new clothes, no matter how advanced the photo system is. I take a lot of screenshots when playing other games, as they remind me of my adventures and time spent in the respective world.\n\nIronically Nikki is probably the one with least amount of screenshots as the game presents so little worth remembering. I want to enjoy doing things as Nikki wearing those clothes in that game world, but constantly engaging with Pieceys, Faewish or disposable NPCs is not interesting especially after 6 months.\n\nComplaning is easy of course, what could possibly happen in a non-combat game? In my opinion, there are two routes the patches could take:\n\n**1- Stardew Route**\n\nPresent us with interesting, recurring characters that ...",

These updates were all waved through under the label \u201cde minimis,\u201d a technicality supposedly meant for small, insignificant tweaks. Replacing a cable. Adjusting a firmware version. That kind of thing.\n\nIf it's considered major, it should trigger a full public evaluation but that\u2019s not what happened.\n\nWhat got approved were sweeping changes: new ballot scanners, modified printers, updated firmware, and an entirely new Electionware reporting module.\n\nThese changes?

He looked super unsure, holding a mug that said \u201cWorld\u2019s Okayest Dad\u201d like it was either the best or worst decision of his life.\n\nI made a light joke\u2014something like \u201cBold choice\u201d\u2014and he laughed, then admitted he had no idea what he was doing. He said his dad doesn\u2019t really do birthdays, but they\u2019d recently started talking again after a rough few years, and he wanted to make an effort.\n\nSo, we spent maybe 20 minutes walking around, just chatting. He eventually picked out a leather journal and a nice pen. \u201cHe writes sometimes,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe this\u2019ll feel personal without being, you know\u2026 cheesy.\u201d\n\nI wished him luck, he thanked me, and I assumed that was that.\n\nFast forward to this past weekend\u2014I was in line at a little street fair when s...",

She said, \u201cI don\u2019t pay you to manage climate control.

"selftext": "PAY YOUR RESPECTS TO THE FUTURE, 2025 Acrylic on Canvas 75 x 114 in/190 x 290 cm (Diptych)\n\nI wanted to make kind of a Memento Mori for our time... It's crazy to me that a plastic bottle that might only pass through our hands for a moment we live longer than we do. And that those traits we treasure as most human -- creativity, problem-solving, and art making -- are quickly being replaced by AI. This painting is my reflection on mortality in the Anthropocene.\n\nThis painting required six months of full-time work. The hardest part was the vultures; I spent about a month on each one. I've been a full-time professional artist since 2008, but this is my first acrylic painting on canvas. I usually paint with oil and egg tempera, but that wouldn't work for a painting this size. ",
