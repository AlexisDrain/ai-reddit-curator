My colleagues threw a small celebratory dinner, and I decided not to invite Marla.\n\nWhy? Because last time I got recognition at work (Employee of the Year award), she spent the entire dinner talking about how she once turned down a big promotion to \u201cprioritize her mental health.\u201d She hijacked every compliment meant for me.\n\nSo this time, I went alone. Told her it was \u201cjust coworkers.\u201d She found out through a tagged photo, and now she\u2019s livid. She accused me of \u201chiding her,\u201d said I \u201cembarrassed her,\u201d and that I made her feel like \u201ca trophy I keep in the closet.\u201d\n\nI explained my reasons and she called me \u201cshallow and insecure.\u201d\n\nI feel awful. But I also feel like I deserved a night where I didn\u2019t have to babysit someone else\u2019s ego.\n\n...",

You\u2019re paid to work. Less talking, more doing.\u201d\n\nI said, \u201cOkay.\u201d\n\nFrom that moment on, I went completely silent. No greetings. No \u201cexcuse me.\u201d No warning when stuff was behind someone. Just silent working robot mode.\n\nShe asked me something later, and I just pointed. She asked,\n\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you answering?\u201d\nI replied,\n\u201cI\u2019m not paid to talk.\u201d\n\nNext shift?

I'm not really expecting a response, but I'll be watching to see if anything comes in. Unless I hear back, this will likely be the final update on this situation.\n\nI also wanted to give a quick shout-out to a few Redditors who helped me craft that email. Your input was invaluable!\n\n * [u/Academic_actuary_590]\n * [u/Snarkerson]\n * [u/blscratch]\n\nAnd so many others it\u2019s hard to keep track. \n\nThanks again to this incredible community!\n",

I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s also why it\u2019s rare to see them in advertisements or on labels. But things change. And I know this Reddit community has probably helped a lot lol.

He asked why he was selling his high end gear and the gentleman responded that he had terminal cancer and he knew his wife didn\u2019t have an idea as to the value of the gear, so he was selling it to get the most money from it.\n\nThose collectibles you\u2019ve been stashing away are possibly not appreciated by those inheriting your belongings, in some cases they want nothing to do with them as they have enough of their own stuff. Then some random people will be dumping out your belongings into a trash bin and come across your good things, much to their good fortune. That\u2019s if they are aware, most times it will get dumped.\n\nSo sell, donate, or advise those that will inherit of the value of the collectibles so they can be appreciated in the future.",

No one told the public. No one reviewed the updates. No one verified the results. But the machines were altered \u2014and now, serious questions are being raised about whether those changes may have affected the outcome of the election. Some are even asking whether Kamala Harris was the one who actually won. \n\nIn the words of watchdog group SMART Elections: \u201cThis wasn\u2019t just a glitch in some sleepy county. It was a stress test of our entire system.\u201d\n\nThe Quiet Move\n\nIn 2024, a federally accredited lab named Pro V&amp;V conducted a wave of hardware and software changes to ES&amp;S voting machines.

Just over a year ago Brie lost her best friend and soul mate when our boy, Lloyd passed away. This past year without him her health continued to deteriorate despite our best attempts to help her. I believe she was dieing of a broken heart. \n\nBrie was a special girl with a loud meow, expressive eyes, and a never-ending obsession with snacks. She loved armpit and thigh massages, sleeping in bed with us like a person with her head on the pillow, and being bundled up like a burrito in any blanket available. She loved sun bathing, her stuffed pickle toy, and was my husband's loyal couch cuddle pal. 13 years was not enough time to love her and so we will love her forever even though she is gone. I know that Lloyd was there to greet her acro...",
