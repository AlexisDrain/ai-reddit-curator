Less for working families.\n\nLet's look at what this legislation does.\n\nAt a time when 85 million Americans are uninsured or underinsured, this bill slashes Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act kicking 17 million more people off their health care, including millions of kids.\n\nIt means if your mom and dad are in a nursing home, they're going to be in trouble because 2/3 of people in nursing homes are supported by Medicaid.\n\nAnd here's an amazing irony.

Huge. Massive. I've never played OOT because my hands are too small to use the Wii u game pad and I'm not paying for a special Nintendo online. So, overall, HUGE. I took it into work and waited with bated breath until I could pop the cartridge into my DS-- it works!! Whoever had the cart before me only got 2 temples deep before giving up. I think I'm gonna see their OG file to the end! All they have in their inventory are bombs sticks nuts and AN EVIL BONE MASK??? Love it.\n\nMy friends said this sounds like Ben drowned so I'm calling it Parking Link. Will update if I am haunted by spirits. If I die please make a lot of bad fanfiction in my honor",

I need you all to be aware of what you voted for. Today with the BBB passing you are now closer to losing your very own hospital in Bellefontaine Ohio. Mary Rutan is projected to be 1 out of 12 hospitals in Ohio that will be heavily hurt by the cuts to Medicaid. If Mary Rutan somehow manages to NOT close down you should fully expect it to have massive cuts to its services. Expect low staff and long lines. But at the end of the day\u2026..this is exactly what the majority of the county voted for. You voted to make your life hard so that some \u201cillegal\u201d or \u201ctrans\u201d person could have an even harder life. When your hospital closes and your family members and friends are dying from preventive illnesses and injuries just remember\u2026..you voted for this. \n\nhttps://familiesusa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rural-Hospital-Medicaid-Analysis.pdf\n\nBottom of page 9\n",

We\u2019re gathering tomorrow at 9:00 AM, starting from Lalbagh Main Gate and marching to the BMRCL office.\n\nThe opening of this metro line has been delayed for years, causing daily inconvenience to civilians and commuters. For everyone who\u2019s been saying \u201cwe need to do something\u201d\u2014now is the time. Let\u2019s unite and take action together.\n\nLet\u2019s show up in large numbers and make our voices heard. Hope to see you all there!\n\nThank you.\n\n#YellowLineOpenMaadi",
