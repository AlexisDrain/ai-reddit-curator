There was an episode of Henry danger where Ray's head was in a box because Cooper Barnes wanted to be there when his daughter was born (a daughter over saving the world, wow man!!!) \n\n4. The funeral scene in Two and a Half men was because they did not want to pay Charlie Sheen any more so they booted him (and he was making rude comments) \n\n5. The Bobby Pin Scene that Killed Maude in the Simpsons was because of a pay dispute her VA was involved in. \n\n",

Well, my mom had a foster kitten, and Franklin and I went to visit for a week (just had surgery and needed help). Franklin and the kitty automatically started cuddling/falling asleep together, playing, etc. They got along so well that I decided this was the perfect opportunity to take in a second cat (a cat that I know Franklin already likes\u2026 perfect). At home they\u2019re still cuddling, and sharing space on my chest/stomach to cuddle as well. I thought that it usually took a long time (upwards of 8-12 months) for cats to bond and they\u2019ve only known each other for 2 weeks. \n\nIs this common? Or are they not truly bonded? Either way, they\u2019re both super happy and are having a fun time playing together. I named the little one Seymour. \n\n ",

Just witnessed a group of boys hollaring and hooting at a young woman on the train. Texted STOPIT and made sure she was okay but still. Its not on. \n\nAs a teacher, its even worse because we try out hardest to stop these little assholes behaving this way, but the culture of disrespect and lack value in education just breeds this culture. Pair that with the Andrew Tate-isms they all have and the rampant misogyny and youve got a situation which, sooner or later, will explode. \n\nAnd yet the authorised officers dont give a fuck about this behaviour, they're too busy picking in students and interning visitors about their mykis.\n\nI dont even know what to do about it at this point.

He said since it\u2019s his name on the lease, I\u2019d need to pay half the bills, do most of the cleaning, and show I\u2019m \u201cserious\u201d before he\u2019d even consider adding me.\n\nWe\u2019ve been together two years. I already cook when I\u2019m there, help him out when he\u2019s overwhelmed, even supported him when he was unemployed. I\u2019m not trying to freeload, I just didn\u2019t expect to be tested like I\u2019m applying for a roommate spot.\n\nI said no thanks, and now he\u2019s saying I\u2019m not ready for a real relationship. Mutual friends are torn, some say I should\u2019ve worked with him, others say I should run.\n\nIt honestly felt more like a power play than a partnership.\n\nNow I\u2019m the problem? AITJ?",

I couldn\u2019t have asked for anything else.\n\nSome highlights:\n\n\u2022 Bought a house in London at 23 \n\n\u2022 Married my girlfriend, after we dated for 6 years \n\n\u2022 I absolutely adore horology, and possess some great pieces including a Rolex. \n\n\u2022 The nature of my work, forces me to travel to everywhere, and because it\u2019s usually long distances, I do fly business and occasional first because of my airline statuses. (Emirates Platinum, AI Gold, and Etihad Silver) \n\n\u2022 I\u2019ve been to 38 countries so far - which includes leisure and business travel.
