People were basically guarding their chargers like their lives depended on it.\n\nI noticed this woman nearby who looked pretty stressed. She kept checking her phone and you could tell it was about to die. I had my power bank with me and, for once, it was actually charged. So I just handed it to her and said, \u201cHey, you can use this if you want.\u201d\n\nShe looked at me like I just handed her a winning lottery ticket. Are you serious? yeah go for it I said.\n\nWhile her phone charged, we started talking. She had just come from a job interview and was heading home. Told me she hadn\u2019t worked in over a year and wasn\u2019t sure if she was still cut out for it. I told her she totally was. We ended up chatting for like half an hour before I had to board. She gave me back the charger, thanked me a bunch, and that was it.\n\nThen last week, I went to this local networking thing I almost skipped. Halfway ...",

To put it bluntly, me and my husband had a surprise baby while we were young, I was on long term birth control at the time (implant in arm) and had to have it removed after we found out I was pregnant. \nLast week we were out for dinner with friends and he was making jokes and slipped in about how he thinks I baby trapped him. No reason for it, nothing to back up this crazy accusation, never mentioned it before but I guess drunk words are sober thoughts? Our friends obviously looked a bit shocked and uncomfortable, especially when they saw my face. \n\nI asked my husband what the heck he was on about and he was saying how it was weird that we\u2019d been sleeping together for 4 years and then I randomly got pregnant. I responded by asking him a flurry of questions like \u201coh did I baby trapped you for your money?\u201d (He and his family were broke, mine is well off), and \u201cdid I baby trap you for your house?\u201d (We lived in one of my parents properties at the time), \u201cdid I b...",

He lived in the same 2BHK for 30 years. Rode a scooter. Vacations? Kerala once. He made no extra income. No side hustle. Nothing.\n\nBut what he did was simple.\nPut 10,000 into a mutual fund in 1998. No one around him was doing that back then.\n\nA couple of years later, he started a 500 SIP. Whenever his salary went up, he increased it. 1000, then 2000, then 5000.\n\nBy 2010, he was putting in \u20b920,000 a month. He never stopped.\n\nWhen he retired at 45, I asked him how he pulled it off.\nHe handed me his passbook and a sheet he printed from CAMS.\n\nThe total corpus: 4.7 crore.\n\nI was stunned. He still lives in the same 2BHK. No upgrades. No show.\nBut now he and my aunt are out travelling almost every weekend. Kids have no idea about his net...",

I was across the states, and being so far from everyone I loved caused me to constantly be in a deep depression that kept threatening my financial stability. So.. I payed my last month, and took 3 Greyhound buses back home. I chose to start from scratch, and not burden my family with another person to house. I took every opportunity that came my way and constantly connected with family in person. The ones that mattered I mean.\n\nWhen people tell you that you can't, do it anyway. If they tell you that you aren't built that way, then make them eat their words. Remember why you get up every single day. And once you have a place to call home, never let anyone take it from you. Plan according and adapt. Breathe. Love yourself. Strive and thrive. You got this.",

I always run around the map collecting all the churches while my teammates for some reason spam ping camps and stuff. The thing is I always end up the same level as them with just the passive rune gain so whatever they are doing doesn't seem to make much difference. Obviously I go and collect the boss drops after I get all the flasks but once I have a good weapon there's really no point of filling the other 5 slots with junk, so I wish my team would prioritize more important things.",

You don\u2019t want to brown the veg too much as it will make the stock too dark. \nFill the pot up with cold water, add whatever trimmings you have from preparing your veg, and bring the stock up to the boil, then leave to reduce. About half way through i add a bit salt, and after preferably 5/6 hours, pass the stock and you can reduce it even further for a more intense flavour. \n\nLet me know if you guys make it any different \ud83e\udd17",

Moreover, Indian Muslims\u2019 emotional investment in the Ummah has not been reciprocated; they are often seen as second-class Muslims by Arabs, with the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) refusing India me...",

We decided to leave because we thought America is the beacon of freedom and hope ... But never in a million years could I imagine that America itself is sliding into a dicatorship.\n\n...",

We are still working with insurance to get his equipment and have been extremely busy with coordinating and mitigating between the doctors, insurance, and medical equipment company to get everything rolling for that.  We have still not been approved through insurance for any equipment and have received denials for everything submitted so far.  We have a peer to peer schedule this coming week for the doctors at the hospital to speak to the insurance doctors and explain the medical necessity for the equipment.  Hoping everything goes well on that front and things can begin to move forward for what Bentley needs.\n\nAs for Bentley himself, he has been fighting multiple resp...",

She just started showing up randomly, watering the plants in the shared courtyard, walking into the laundry room without knocking, and giving unsolicited advice on how I should properly park my car.\n\nOne day I\u2019m cooking in my kitchen and I hear the screen door open. I come out and find this woman in my backyard (shared space, but still), moving my flower pots around. I politely asked her what she was doing, and she just goes:  \u201cOh, I\u2019m the landlord\u2019s sister. I helped him decorate this place. These don\u2019t look good here.\u201d\n\nI told her I rented that unit and I will prefer if she didn\u2019t move my stuff without asking. She rolled her eyes and literally said: \u201cWell, you\u2019re just a tenant. I\u2019m family.\u201d\n\nThe next week she knocks on my door and asks if I can move out...",

My wife is fully aware and even jokingly nicknamed it my Kong.\n\nAnyway, before I went to bed after my last shift, I washed it and left it on the dish rack in the kitchen. Usually I put it away immediately, but I guess I was overworked and I passed out without thinking twice.\n\nSo fast forward to today. I come home after 16 hours of nonstop work.
