I feel like I have passed my Cat-reddit exam! \n\nShe is already super cuddly and loves to nap; it\u2019s clear we were destined to be together.

It is so amazing and inspiring to see her rocking the desk even after those news and I feel like she has improved her game a bit this year in all aspects of desk hosting. Even after all these years you can see that she is trying to improve her game more and more and I think we are blessed that she is probably the face of the desk when it comes to League! We see people come and go in our scene, but she truly stayed a pillar when it comes to the esports scene, creating the League Awards, trying to improve the scene as much as she can!\n\nI hope this company treats her well and we get many many more years of her hosting the LEC and internationals!

He left behind a mess, but also the silence I\u2019ve craved for so long.\n\nSo tonight, I popped a bottle of Pol Roger (Churchill\u2019s favorite), grilled artichokes and corn, and indulged in black truffle burrata under the trees on my balcony. I got a little drunk. I blasted music. I danced around in my underwear. I lit candles. I felt free.\n\nThe past two years were rough. The past year was the worst. But now\u2026 I\u2019m alone. Not lonely. Alone. And it feels like peace.\n\nIf you\u2019re still in the trenches \u2014 sharing space, counting the days \u2014 hang in there. Your quiet morning, your undisturbed fridge, your ability to decorate however the hell you want\u2026 it\u2019s coming.

I keep calling, no answer. He shows up with a full tray of food, smiling like nothing\u2019s wrong. The gate\u2019s closed. Again. This is the third time he's made us miss a flight because he doesn\u2019t take timing seriously.\n\nI just lost it. I told him I was done and walked out of the airport. now he\u2019s blowing up my messages saying I overreacted and \u201cleft him stranded.\u201d my friends are split. some say I should\u2019ve waited, others say he needed a wake-up call.\n\nI feel a mix of guilt and relief.

Afterwards Quentin comes up to him and says \u201cYou don\u2019t think you are going to be wearing that hat in the movie, do you?\u201d Michael was not planning to, he was just wearing his hat, but now kinda wants to since someone told him not to. The next day Quentin tells him he now wants him to wear the hat so he does. In the scene in the bar where he goes \u201cThat fucking hat. I want you to keep that shit kicker hat at home\u201d. The lines were not in the script and that was Michaels genuine reaction. He believes that it was planned by Quentin and Larry Bishop.\n\nSource: \u00a0Podcast: One bad movie with Stephen Baldwin; Michael Madsen.",

We went to a nice restaurant, and I ordered a simple $20 pasta with a soda because I\u2019m still budgeting. Jess ordered a $90 steak, appetizer, cocktails, and dessert.\n\nWhen the bill came, she pulled out her phone, and said, \u201cLet\u2019s just split it.\u201d I laughed nervously, thinking she was joking. Nope. She doubled down, rolling her eyes like I was being ridiculous for even suggesting separate checks.\n\nI told her I\u2019d pay for what I ordered. She got loud, telling me I was \u201ccheap,\u201d \u201cungrateful,\u201d and basically accused me of trying to mooch off her. Later, she sent me a Venmo request for more than my share ($58) with a \u201csince you forgot &lt;3\u201d caption and started telling our friends I \u201cembarrassed\u201d her at dinner.\n\nSome of them say I should\u2019ve just paid to avoid drama, but honestly, it felt like she baited me into footing part of her feast. AITA?",

He didn't leave my side when I was bedridden for days and when I broke my arm. He was there on our bed first thing in the morning and would stay up with me when I would watch movies well past our bedtimes.\n\nI've had to lie about his breed, telling people he's a mutt etc. People didn't ask much after that because he had a knack for winning over humans.

No sweet smells, no baking music from the kitchen. I figured she took it seriously.\n\nThen it hit me.\nThe dishwasher? Still full.\nThe garbage? Overflowing.\nThe sink? Piled with dishes.\nThe groceries I asked her to unpack? Still sitting in bags.\n\nI asked what was going on and she goes:\n\"You said don\u2019t touch anything in the kitchen, remember? So I didn\u2019t.\"\n\nTouch\u00e9.\n\nWe renegotiated the rule now it\u2019s: \u201cYou can bake if you clean like a pro.\u201d\n\nShe agreed. I got cookies. She got victory. Fair trade.\n\n\n",
