"selftext": "In the past few minutes we received a lot of requests for special flairs celebrating the Horndog's firing. \n\nSo in order to properly commemorate this historic event we decided to create a limited edition flair, featuring a limited edition emoji made by uwu/Blanchimont.\n\nThis flair can only be claimed in the next 76 hours. So if you want to have proof so that you can brag to all the future members of the community that you were here when history was made, this is your chance. If you change your flair back after the 76 hours you will not be able to recover the limited edition flair.\n\nTo claim this flair all you have to do is to send a comment under this post including the words \"File 76\" or \"Cocoa Pops\" (and pray that AutoModerator doesn't crash and burn)\n\nP.S: We send our most sincere apologies to the admins responsible for the servers",

Opportunities in Ecuador, especially in creative fields like art or video, are quite limited.\n\nI have a fund of around $30,000, which was given to me by the U.S. government after my dad passed away when I was a kid. I stopped receiving that support when I turned 18. Before, the fund had a lot more in it, but I spent a large portion on education right after high school programs I eventually didn\u2019t follow through with.\n\nSince I was a kid, my family has never really spent money on me because of that fund. It\u2019s always been that way; they saw the fund as my financial responsibility, so I\u2019ve learned to rely on it for most things.\n\nRecently, my girlfriend was accepted into a dance academy in Germany.

She never got in trouble, was always right, got WHATEVER she wanted and acted HOWEVER she wanted.\n\nMy parents didn\u2019t treat me badly though, but if I got 1 toy, Princess got 5. It sucked, I was jealous, and I got in trouble for it.\n\nPrincess got worse around age 6 when she realized how much she could get away with. She broke my things, hurt others, stole, and hated when anyone else had attention. I became a target. Luckily, I had friends, school, and relatives for support though so it wasn\u2019t the worst. I did great in school and joined clubs and sports just to stay out of the house. During summer I worked or interned just to avoid her.\n\nNow I have a car and a boyfriend (since sophomore year).

He was very persistent in pursuing me, constantly texting, making plans, asking me to go on runs, bike rides, and beach days (we live in Florida), and inviting me to dinner, bars, and even paying for Ubers to and from his place. We were hanging out at least 4 times a week.\n\nEverything felt like it was going somewhere. He\u2019d been slowly building things up and even waited weeks to finally kiss me. Then, out of nowhere, he sends me a literal Excel spreadsheet with a breakdown of dates, how much he spent, and a column with my name, asking me to reimburse him. I\u2019m attaching it because I truly can\u2019t believe it. It felt transactional and weirdly formal, especially since he was the one initiating nearly all the plans.\n\nWhat\u2019s even more confusing: after sending this, he still insists on seeing me and continuing to date. Like, you want to invoice me and kiss me?\n\nAnd for context, I\u2019ve picked up the tab quite a ...",

Meetings are mostly audio and shared screen. \n\nOne unpopular program manager has begun to make it a point to ask everyone to turn cameras on \u201cfor better communication\u201d. \n\nHe called me out today and I discovered a lovely bit of maliciousness.  I turned my camera on, and we immediately discovered why TV announcers dress simply.  I was wearing a golf polo with fine horizontal stripes.  Every time I moved, a moire pattern danced across the screen. It was the most obnoxious, attention grabbing thing I\u2019ve ever heard.  Cue five minutes of razzing me about my shirt.  \n\nI spent the rest of the meeting fidgeting in my chair.  I can\u2019t wait for next week\u2019s meeting.   I have several more shirts with similar patterns.  ",

She\u2019ll dip her paws in the water a few times, then push the water against the side of the bowl while she drinks (she\u2019s able to get some serious distance while doing it too, it\u2019s honestly impressive). This was a known issue and I was given a bunch of left over pee-pads to keep underneath the water while she does this. However, she still manages to make a mess, despite me getting a water fountain for her which she REFUSES to entertain. Point of the post I guess; for anyone who had similar issues with your cat, what kind of bowl did you use to stop/deduce the spillage? I\u2019ve got a few bowls picked out that I think will work but I\u2019d like to avoid \u201ctrail and error\u201d if I have to",

If the child was younger than eight, then Mormons would say that the child was guaranteed a place in the celestial kingdom.  ",
