"selftext": "\nFurther context and sources in comments:\n\nJust over a week ago, Co-founders of Unknown Worlds, Ted Gill, Charlie Cleveland, and Max McGuire were fired abruptly and without reason.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that they had little involvement in development of Subnautica 2 itself. \n\nThe community was given no reason why, and we can only continue to speculate.\n\nHowever, today, Krafton delayed Subnautica 2 to 2026. Despite developers maintaining their original deadline as soon as 2 days ago.\n\nIt\u2019s also been revealed that had Unknown Worlds reached a quota this year, they would have received 250 million dollars in bonuses that would be spread to ALL staff.\n\nThis delay is simply so they don\u2019t have to give those bonuses. They\u2019ve already made 250 million dollars off of scamming developers. Don\u2019t let them make more.",

When I asked if she was at home, she still didn\u2019t reply yet. About half an hour later, she said she was home and had taken a shower already. I didn\u2019t overthink bc I was out with my friend and we were heading on to a bar. I text with my gf on and off for about an hour, and then she said she was really tired and wanted to sleep. It was only around 9pm while she normally sleeps around 11 or 12. I thought she just had a rough day, so we said goodnight. Everything was find until I saw her in the bar with her friends together, guys and girls. Clearly, she lied to me. I was really mad at that time but I didn\u2019t say anything and just left with my friend. I haven\u2019t told her I saw her at that night yet, and my opinion of her has already changed. Should I just end things or talk to her about it?",

I couldn\u2019t find any other plausible reason for it being there.\n\nThe cherry on top of it all is that the past week my partner and I have heard strange noises at night coming from the direction of this door. For example, tonight we heard a sound that was familiar to the laugh of a dingo. The other night it sounded like a woman quietly wailing. We\u2019ve heard tons of noises since we live in an apartment complex, but these have just been\u2026 weird.\n\nWe\u2019ve only had two WTF moments in our own apartment that potentially revolved around the paranormal, but this is just giving us a weird vibe.

Last year I told myself once my account breaks $1m profit, I will sell the entire position, lock in the gains, and have a hell of a story to share for life.  Well today Nvidia hit a new all time high and I made that dream come true.\n\nBelow is a long version of how it all came to be: \n\nI first acquired Nvidia back in Feb 2017 and in a few lump sum purchases wound up with a total of 6,500 shares of NVDA.  My first purchase was for 1080 (in honor of my GTX 1080 I bought that year) and the share price at the time was a whopping $2.77!  My total investment around this time was $4000.  \n\nBack in 2017 all the talk was about Crypto mining and I naively thought Nvidia was the way Bitcoin would be mined forever so I bought into the mantra \u201cduring a gold rush, buy the company selling the shovels\u201d.

When we were both 15 she got pregnant and we were super excited to have this baby. We found out it was a girl and named her Alice after a character in a movie we both like. Unfortunately she had a late term miscarriage when she was 6 months along. After her miscarriage she turned suicidal to the point where she had to be in a mental hospital for months. Her parents were abusive to her and were treating her horribly during this time. When she was finally discharged she decided that she can no longer live with her parents so she moved in with my dad and I. We were 16 at this time and she seemed happier we were constantly partying but she kept talking about how much she misses Alice we got her cremated and ...",

I\u2019m not a radiologist, so I\u2019m not sure if her CT just didn\u2019t show if it\u2019s already metastasized to bone. I\u2019m waiting on a referral to an oncologist. \n\nWe just lost her bonded mate a couple weeks ago. My heart hurts that she has to battle cancer without him, all by herself. He fortunately got to live his entire life by her side, and now my baby girl has to do it alone. It\u2019s heart-breaking. I\u2019ve been sleeping on the floor when I can so she isn\u2019t as lonely. I remember the day I got her as a baby (top photo), and almost every day in between til now (last photo). Please wish her luck",

Sincerest apologies to the mods.)\n\nSo\u2014many leftists feel betrayed because I haven\u2019t made a video on Palestine. Do they actually want a ContraPoints video about Palestine? Will they be happy if I get in the bath and pour milk on a mannequin of Benjamin Netanyahu? No. I have posted about Gaza occasionally, and have quietly given money to Palestinian aid organizations. But I think what leftists really want is for me to join their chorus of anger. They sense some hesitation on my part, and are judging me very harshly on my presumed opinions. I\u2019d rather be judged on my actual opinions. So, here they are:\n\nIs Israel committing genocide in Gaza? Yes. Do I oppose it? Yes. Do I feel angry about it? Yes. I also feel a lot of other things:\n\nI. Doom. The week after October 7 it was clear the mood among Israeli leaders and civilians was overwhelmingly kill-or-be-killed existential panic ...",

I also had another seperate cake the same size as the bottom tier (11\u201d) set aside in the kitchen for extra slices.

Hours later, Shopee returned me 118 coins which less than 0.02% of the total prize money won. No clear explanation, no email, no reason. I reached out to customer service multiple times.
