"selftext": "It\u2019s my in-laws\u2019 30th wedding anniversary coming up and they haven\u2019t been able to use the photo with the whole family because the groom\u2019s sister wore white and the photographer didn\u2019t do a very good job with placement and people. The bride is in the veil and has children on her lap while the white dress wearing sister is the one in the all white puff sleeve gown with no children on her lap. \n\nI\u2019m wondering if it is at all possible to 1: change the colour of the sister\u2019s dress to a different colour that blends in with what other people are wearing, 2: perhaps move the kids that are in front of my mother in law and on her lap over to the sister (whose kids they actually are) so the focus is on the bride where it belongs. \nI have attached another photo of the bride so you have a full idea of her dress without kids in front or on her. \n\n",

He passed the first round, and both I and everyone involved in the second round really liked his resume and experience. On paper, he had everything we were looking for, and honestly, this looked like a life-changing opportunity for him.\n\nThen he shows up, very serious and not smiling at all. I'm used to that in tech interviews, and I understand it can be an intimidating environment.\n\nWe did a round of introductions, and then he opened the interview by saying, \"Let me tell you a little bit about myself.\" We said, okay, go for it.\n\nHe started talking and talking about his personal and professional background. After about three minutes, I jumped in to ask a follow-up question based on something he mentioned. He replied, \"I will answer, just give me a moment,\" and continued talking.\n\nA coworker jumped in with another question, and he said the same thing to her.\n\nAt this point, we were kind of looking at each othe...",

He reminded me that overtime is time and a half, and he\u2019ll totally authorize me to work a few extra hours. I said no. Just no. That\u2019s it. One word. His face did something scary and he walked away, but then he came back and told me he really appreciated knowing where we stood and thanked me for my honesty. It felt\u2026 wrong.\n\nMandatory overtime is legal where I\u2019m at, but we\u2019ll cross that bridge when we get to it.\n\n\nUPDATE\n\n\nWe all knew I was going to be fired. It\u2019s not a surprise. \nBut the good news is, I took a few very vital functions with me. No one else knows how to do them, and there\u2019s no documentation. My old teammates are telling me they haven\u2019t seen old \u201cPaul\u201d around in a while, meaning he\u2019s over in the head honcho building getting drilled. \n\n",

"selftext": "I have seen a lot of Durges where they are gorgeous, beautiful, stunning, and overall perfect, but according to the known lore, this happens according to the wiki [link here](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/The_Dark_Urge#History):\n\n*\"After the Dark Urge put the Crown on the elder brain, they were soon betrayed by their \"sister\" Orin the Red, who was jealous of Bhaal's favouritism. Orin pierced and opened the Dark Urge's skull with a dagger, and infected them with a tadpole which began to eat their liquidating brain, resulting in their amnesia, as well as them becoming the first True Soul.\"*\n\nSo why not make a Durge where they have facial trauma and permanent scarring from that encounter/ordeal? I used mods solely found in the Mod Manager, no Nexus. If you want to know what they are, I'm more than happy to share!",

The fact that he has no feelings.\n\nNothing he did was personal at all, and everything was just part of his plan, and if you were unlucky enough to get harmed by his plan, then too bad for you. This dude has no feelings at all and his dreams above all.",
