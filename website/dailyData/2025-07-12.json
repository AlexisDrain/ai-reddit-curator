I\u2019m on the second floor, and my balcony is my sanctuary, I\u2019ve turned it into a mini jungle with potted herbs, hanging flowers, a hammock chair, and solar lights.\n\nLast week, I came home to find three of my pots moved, my lavender trampled, and someone had plucked almost all my cherry tomatoes.\n\nTurns out, my downstairs neighbor\u2019s sister (who doesn\u2019t even live here) was letting her 6-year-old daughter come up the stairs and play on my balcony when I wasn\u2019t home. \u201cShe likes pretending it\u2019s a fairy garden,\u201d she said when I confronted her.\n\nI told her that was trespassing and not safe at all. She said, \u201cWell, you don\u2019t own the balcony, it\u2019s part of the building. You just rent.\u201d (I\u2019ve lived here for 4 years. She was visiting for the weekend.)\n\nI told the landlord, who sided with me immediately.

Mary was thrilled that she had found a really nice man after her divorce, and Bill was wonderful to Mary. Bill was \"living the dream\" during those years, because Mary was still working and he was retired, which meant he had lots of free time to himself almost every day. He was able to pursue all his hobbies- golfing, fishing, and going to car shows. On weekends, Mary and Bill would do things together. When Mary would use her accrued vacation time (2 weeks a year), they would go places together. Sometimes Bill would go on trips with his guy friends or family and Mary would have to stay home and work, but that happens when you are both in different places in your lives.\n\nFinally Mary reached retirement age. Now it was her turn to enjoy her days doing what she loved. She wanted to add a water feature to her garden, and go on some sight seeing trips. But things didn't wo...",

He wants me to pay 40% of it ($600), even though I\u2019ve asked him so many times not to keep the heater on as much as he does. Now he\u2019s saying I\u2019m selfish, manipulative, and \u201cnot a real teammate.\u201d I\u2019m starting to question myself, but here\u2019s the full story.\n\nHe keeps the heater on 30C or (86F) for 11 hours a day, every single day. I\u2019ve asked him over and over again to turn it down or off, I literally can\u2019t afford it, and it\u2019s uncomfortable for me. I make $1,400 per fortnight, and this bill is way beyond what I can manage. He, on the other hand, gets $30,000 every 6 months from his parents and doesn\u2019t work and is at home all day every day.\n\nHe wants to split the bill 60/40, him paying $900 and me $600. But I didn\u2019t agree to use that much gas, and I physically couldn\u2019t if I wanted to (I am a full time law student which is around 12h pw on campus and work 28h pw).
