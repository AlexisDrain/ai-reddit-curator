"selftext": "I was watching the new Superman movie with my wife and the person sitting in front of us took out his phone, during the movie. I figured not to say anything because it was quick. After he did it two more times, I leaned in and said, \" Could you go outside if your going to look at your phone? It's distracting.\" He said, \"What?\" So I repeated what I said. He said, \"Are you serious?\" I said \"yeah\". He just shook his head and turned around.\n\nMy heart was racing at this point from adrenaline, totally taken out of the movie experience. Thankfully he didn't look at his phone again,  but he kept making comments to his friend, that's another story with his friend and girlfriend talking during the movie. After the movie ended they got up, made some comments to each other, looked at me and walked out. \n\nThis is not your home, people payed good money to have a movie going experience and having a phone open in a dark room ruined it.",

So one week, he came in and I mentioned to him that I'd started re-watching Stargate from the very beginning. I also mentioned that I'd never seen the last three seasons or any of the spin-offs so I was excited to see them.\n\nThe first thing he says is, \"Oh so you don't know about [detailed description of something that happens in the final season]?\"\n\nI was like, \"Whoa! No spoilers!\"\n\nWhich should have been enough. But it wasn't. \n\nEvery week he'd come back in and spoil it for me even more. And every week I would tell him to please not spoil it for me.\n\nThis went on for about two months. Between the regularity of it and the smirk he'd get on his face every time I asked him not to tell me spoilers, I knew he was doing it on purpose. \n\nSo, one week, he came in and bought a big pile of comics he'd ordered. I wait...",

Ten. Not some random handshake photo. He was flying on the plane, partying with him, and there are tapes of Epstein literally saying Trump slept with women on his private flights.

When I came home from work after working a 12 hour shift I cooked rice and beans and then went to bed to work another 12 hour shift the next day. He texted me during work and sent this. When I got home things escalated and he packed everything and left. Am I overreacting? Why go to this extreme and leave over some food?\n\nUPDATE: Thanks everyone for the support! I read a lot of the comments and tried to respond to a lot of the DM\u2019s. He came back and begged for therapy and I tried to make it work for a month but I had already mentally checked out so I have filed for divorce and moved out of our apartment.

But you can see literally within 30 min of leaving the \u201ccheck ins\u201d began and it was just very quickly down hill and I know that\u2019s when I should have put a boundary. I felt uncomfortable and didn\u2019t know how to put my foot down till the end which you will see. Again i\u2019m new to this area, didn\u2019t want to get a bad review or worst case have them get me fired from my new job so I kind of just let myself be a door mat. Major learning lesson. Anyway here are the pics not everything but just to give a better idea of what was going on. Again, maybe I\u2019m getting this wrong but plz lmk. ",

You change one little thing and the future can change drastically. \n\nAnd yet ... The main character, in a situation where he wants to prove to someone that he has special Jesus like powers, goes back to his own childhood to a moment in class and makes a drastic change by violently mutilating himself in front of everyone, and then *ZIP* somehow we're back to the same point in the future and the only thing that changed was that he now has scars on his hands?!?\n\nWHACK\n\nAnyone have some other candidates?",

We moved to a different state for her to go to college. So we both had to get new jobs, I found one off the  bat. She took a couple months to find something. So I started paying for everything. Eventually she came around and started paying for groceries. But she doesn\u2019t have money for anything else.  She does have a couple of kids. So she has them full time and the father doesn\u2019t pay any child support. I mean I make pretty good money but I don\u2019t feel I should be paying for everything. Plus she decided not to go to college any more.  \n \n Anyway, we were out to dinner the other night and I forget exactly how the topic came up but it had to do with her kids. I guess I was giving advice when that wasn\u2019t my intention. I thought we were just talking about issues. Anyway, she proceeded to tell me how I\u2019m not a parent and I ...",

Never met my grampa, but I hear he was a piece of shit. The card verifies that. He died in a drunk driving accident head on with a semi in rural Tennessee at 68 years of age (moved there from Florida when my dad was still in school). Used to chase my dad and grandma around the yard with a gun when he was on a bender, so all things considered he probably deserved the untimely death. Karma is wild like that.\n\nWith that said my dad is definitely racist, but not klan level racist. I am 0% racist. Living proof of the world changing for the better with every generation passed.

Somehow it turned into her moving into our guest room and treating the whole house like her personal shopping mall.\n\nShe\u2019s been helping herself to my clothes, my snacks, and most annoyingly, my makeup. I told her nicely (more than once), \u201cplease stop using my makeup. That stuff isn\u2019t cheap and you don\u2019t even ask.\u201d\nShe\u2019d just laugh and say \u201coh come on, you have so much. You won\u2019t even notice.\u201d\n\nWell I noticed. Every time.\n\nSo one day I switched out the label on an old concealer tube with one that matched my current shade. The old one was way too light, borderline ghostly. I left it sitting on top of my vanity like bait.\n\nSure enough, I hear her in the bathroom later that day, humming while doing it her face. Didn\u2019t say a word.\n\nNext week, she shows up to a family dinner wearing full glam and her under eyes were blinding. Like,...",

That is suspicious and I wish positivity can be spoken more often than the negativity one.\n\nAs you can see from my previous post, I actually went to the event.\n\nI just want to say, no one can absolutely foresee any single emergencies that could happen in the future. The criteria of judging a good event is not by whether there's out-out-planned situations happening, but by whether they can handle them well. They immediately pulled out the air conditioner when Caleb cosplayer was unwell, giving him the medicine, and immediately banned any \"carry up\" fan service. Even before he's unwell, he has the power to pause the interaction any time he wants, and staff will run up and bring water and heat reduction service to him. That's what I heard from the staff in person and what I saw with my own eyes. \n\nThere was a girlie who dressed up classic Greek style and s...",

Having 30-45 minute long sections where you are unable to save is bad game design, and even worse is when games don't let you save wherever or whenever you want.\n \nI'm aware that it's a \"gameplay reason\" or whatever other bullshit you want to say, but being unable to save for extreme stretches of time is the most backwards ass thing in gaming. Being completely unable to, say, load a game up and play for 15 minutes and then save wherever you are should be in 99% of games.\n\nAnd no, I'm not a fucking dumbass, I know why some games can't let you save wherever you want, but I'm not talking about Dead Space or Resident Evil or whatever else does it. I'm talking about RPG games where there's no damn excuse other than the devs didn't want to put it in. If there is a legitimate reason why it's not possible, please tell me, because Pok\u00e9mon has been doing it since the first fucking game and they rarely have problems with saving as far as I've experienced.
