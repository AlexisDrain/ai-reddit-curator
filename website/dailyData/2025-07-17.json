The data gathered in the new report doesn\u2019t back up those concerns, with only 17 percent of those in the pilot leaving employment once the basic income payments commenced. And, most significantly, nearly half of those subjects who stopped working during the pilot returned to school or university to up-skill for future employment.",

"selftext": "A known stray mama cat recently had a litter of kittens. I saw mama and 3 kittens under my shed 2 weeks ago. On July 7th, she vacated with 2 of the kittens (I watched her leave with them), and I haven't seen them since.\n\nThis evening, my neighbor called - she caught a kitten. She said it had been around her back porch for about a week, alone, with no litter mates or mama, so she grabbed it. Did I know anyone who might want to help the kitten?\n\nSo now I have a tiny baby in my dog's crate in the basement. Um... what do I do? Looks to be a little male, about 2 bananas big. \n\nHe's nibbling at the wet food, but is crying and trying to get out of the crate. He's generally friendly, I can handle him and he purrs very loudly. I'm experienced with cats, but not babies. I have 2 adult cats, so I know I need to keep him isolated for a while. ",

"selftext": "Architect here \ud83d\udc4b\n\nOur homes start absorbing heat around sunrise &amp; start radiating it the minute they get warmer than the surrounding air temperature. They are literally like solar batteries. Some homes have a higher thermal mass &amp; store greater amounts of heat (especially homes that have CMU bricks, made of Ferro concrete or a composite cement cladding). For those of you who have infrared cameras, point them at your south facing walls (especially at night) to have your minds blown! Homes &amp; buildings with high thermal masses turn into ovens after mid day &amp; only cool down some hours after sunset.\n\nWhat to do:\nIf you have a north facing room, it is best to move there, after noon. Better still, move to the basement, if you have one. If you have neither and don\u2019t have AC, the fastest way to cool down is to dunk a long sleeve cotton shirt (or dress) in water, wring it out, put it on &amp; turn the fan on full speed. Do this a few times as the shirt/dress starts to dry out....",

The post annoyed me quite a bit and just reminded me of two other incidents that I mentioned above. In response I took that same picture, rubbed out my daughter and reposted it in the comments section with a caption that read \"I've fixed that picture for you\". \n\nBoth my brother and my sister in law sent me really long angry messages, telling me to get therapy and proceeded to block me on social media. \n\nAm I the Asshole?

"selftext": "As the title says, I (36M) have recently discovered that my wife (34F) is cheating on me.\n\nI first noticed changes to her behaviour a couple of months ago such as wanting to spend more time with her colleagues after work.  \nThis was unusual behaviour for her as she's usually not the drinking type, and she's also never been one to socialise much with her work colleagues.  \nShe's always been a homebody who prefers staying home with me and cuddling up on the sofa in the evening. But these past couple of months she's been going out 1-2 times a week after work and she'll often arrive home at around 9pm.\n\nShe'd always message me once she arrived there, would check to see if I found the dinner okay (she often bulk cooks our dinners and freezes them) and would then message me again when she's on her way home.\n\nAt first I didn't think much of this because I thought that it was good that she was socialising with her colleagues. That is till I noticed a message notification that she received i...",

"selftext": "When she was taken in (Day 1), they said she's young and fighting very hard to live.  She's on an IV and staying there for tests.  They said expect the worst but hope for the best.\n\nHer body temperature was very low, 95 degrees.  She got an IV with warm liquids and a heating pad.  \n\n\nToday (Day 2 AM), they said she is in and out of consciousness, but when she is in, she seems to be aware.  She sits up, and even drinks from a water dish on her own.\n\nBloodwork shows kidneys in bad shape (which could just be from the dehydration, here's hoping they get better).  She has a bit of jaundice and a pretty serious infection.\n\nShe's getting more fluid and antibiotics.  \"Prognosis still guarded at this time, but if she continues to improve, we can be more optimistic.\"\n\n  \n(Day 2 PM) They took her off the IV briefly so the kids could see her.  She was purring when they pet her.\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nA lot of you have been sending positive optimistic messages which really help with the mood,\n\nIt's not my cat....",

I posted my info on the site and a couple from California contacted me, as wife did not produce eggs and could not carry baby.  They were interested in my eggs in particular because I already had three healthy children, and they both had red hair and green eyes; as do I and all of my children.  They ended up having 3 healthy children, which I guess are technically half me biologically and half her husband.  This happened over the course of a few years with a surrogate.  I never saw pictures, didn't ask to, and didn't communicate with them after the last child.  I received $5000 at the time and it was sorely needed for anything from medical bills to d...",
