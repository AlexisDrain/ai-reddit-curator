So of course other toddlers book it out and Karen continues to hold the gate open and does NOTHING to prevent this and just keeps yelling at her kid. \n\nInstant chaos as parents and a grandparent scramble out to catch the escaped tots. Toddlers are running to open elevators, to balconies, into the managers office, and my child was booking it towards the stairs.

I wanted to share that we had our IRL ceremony of eternal bonding in May of this year, and naturally made *everything* FFXIV themed &lt;3 All of the centerpieces were designed by my husband! Each table was a specific job with a plaque for guests to find their seats. Our signature drinks were Elixirs, too. We had some difficulties getting the surrounding portion of the aetherytes to stay steady, but otherwise everything turned out perfect! 99% of our guests were not video game people, let alone FFXIV people, so it was fun to share this part of our lives with everyone so dear to us. :) ",

Renly alone had 100,000 soldiers, I don\u2019t know how many Stannis had at this point, but I have to imagine their combined forces would be ridiculous. I\u2019m sure Renly and Davos would have been able to convince Stannis to make peace with Robb, the Lannisters would get crushed on 2 sides until they\u2019re forced to surrender, and then with Stannis on the throne, eventually dealing with the Night King and White Walkers would have been a much easier situation.

Basically what you need to know is, I have a huge, very tight scar that covers my entire stomach due to it. Scar tissue, especially scar tissue that thick and severe, isn\u2019t elastic like skin. You can probably see where I\u2019m going with this.\n\nI\u2019m infertile on a technicality. I could theoretically get pregnant but keeping it would be a death sentence because my abdomen wouldn\u2019t be able stretch to accommodate it. It would be extremely dangerous and doctors have advised against it. This fact doesn\u2019t bother me that much. I\u2019m gay and never wanted kids in the first place.

Paid the fee, and when the item turned up it was a bar of chocolate that a UK based friend had sent weeks previously and which we'd both assumed had been \"lost\". It had a large letter stamp on it, and when I weighed and measured it I discovered that it was well within the weight and measurements specified for a large letter...so I have complained to RM asking for a refund of the fee I paid. Yes, the amount of money involved is negligible,  but it's the principle of the thing. If they stopped giving their shareholders thumping great bonuses, RM wouldn't need to chisel money out of people who've done nothing wrong.",
