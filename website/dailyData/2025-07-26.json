I\u2019ve worked with it before and I knew what was happening, but I remembered the rule.\nSo I let the supervisor know. He barely looked up and said, \u201cDon\u2019t touch it unless it\u2019s your job.\u201d\nAlright then. I went back to packing.\nTen minutes later, the thing actually caught fire.\nWe had a clear out the whole floor. Maintenance took their sweet time showing up.\nThe machine was toast. Production was shut down for the rest of the day.\nThey quietly dropped the \u201cdon\u2019t touch anything\u201d rule after that.\nI just did what I was told.",

"selftext": "Hey,\nI just got my first payment of $150 through freelancing. I\u2019m 18, and honestly, it still feels a bit unreal because just 2\u20133 weeks ago, I was literally scrolling through posts like this, wondering how the hell are people younger than me already earning? And here I was, just lying on the sofa, overthinking. \n\nTo be real with you \u2014 seeing posts like these used to frustrate me and used to ruin my whole day. Not because I hated on people earning, but because I didn\u2019t know how they were doing it. I\u2019d ask them and they'd say \u201cfreelancing,\u201d and I\u2019d be like, bro HOW TF?! Where are you finding these clients? What are you even doing?\n\nOne day I stopped overthinking and just decided to try. I had some basic video editing skills from before \u2014 nothing pro, but I knew enough to get started. I found out that working with international clients helps a lot.

Also, he's wanting to clean his beak after eating, but I'm not sure just what I can put in his little box that will work? I did replace the glass water bowl so he doesn't hurt his beak. \n\nAgain, thank you all for listening and rooting for our friend. Maybe we should also give him/her a proper name? I wish I knew the gender! ",

She complained how there is a big gap and roses need fillers like baby breaths. She proceeded to say how she told me she didnt want flowers from the local grocery store but not to go to a bouquet flower store either (uhm ok). \n\nI kinda just said \"okay, thanks for letting me know, the reason I'm hesitant on getting bouquets is my cat likes to eat flowers and they can be very bad for them, but she also deserves better then me just going to the store picking out whatever I found nice/ easy and I should put in more effort\" \n\nOnce the convo was over she said she felt bad tell...",

Even when things didn\u2019t click around him, he kept grinding, kept scoring. Quietly showing up week after week.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t just a striker for us , he was the structure. The guy who brought belief back to a side that had just lost legends.\n\nHe didn\u2019t just score , he *stabilized* us.\n\nSo yeah, this is just a small thank you post to say: we see you, Lewa. Maybe you don't get all the flowers you deserve, but real ones know.\n\nThank You, Lewy. \ud83d\udc99\u2764\ufe0f",

We asked why, since we hadn\u2019t overstayed, but they had no explanation.

Compare yourself to the OGs and GOATS of the genre like Halo, Cod, Battlefield, etc.\n\n4. Launch your game\n\n5. Turns out it's filled with overpriced microtransactions, a shitty Battle Royalr mode, and half-baked game modes and terrible maps\n\n6. Lose 98% of your playerbase",

It's also funny that they thought to call-in AM radio outrage merchants Vicki McKenna and Dan O'Donnell (and also, the pair at Wisconsin Right Now), who seem to be similar focused on all the wrong stuff. It looks like pedophilia is no long a red line for MAGA. This is where we are. \n\nHow do these people sleep at night? ",
