V goes full Yautja and turns invisible. \n\n2: Biomonitor. You can flat out die and come back if you have this one equipped.\n\n3: Bullet deflection perk. Depending on how you tweak your build, you can buff the stamina for deflection to pretty high levels. Self explanatory. \n\n4: Sandevistan. This is also fairly self explanatory.\n\n5: Smart weapons. Lock on systems are pretty powerful, becomes even more powerful with explosive bullets.\n\n6: If you take the Berserk\u2019s invulnerability effect seriously, V is practically invincible to old-school firearms and explosives. Pair this with gorilla arms and it\u2019s even worse.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot more but this is a meme post so i\u2019m not going wild with it lol.",

None of that open BS from 2042. I felt really immersed in them.\n-The movement is great. I can\u2019t remember any point where I felt outplayed by movement, despite the fact that I was playing against professional gamers.\n-The tanks feel so good.\n-I don\u2019t think the visual clutter is overwhelming. The squadmate outlines were very useful in squad death match\n-The sound design was phenomenal.\n-Not gameplay related but I spoke to a community manager named Liam and he made me really optimistic about our voices being heard.\n\nI am not a streamer or content creator. I\u2019m not some\nhigh ranked player. Just a normal dude who casually plays the game. Despite the picture, I ended up playing on mouse and keys. ...",

His diet when I lived there consisted of pizza, fries and burgers and beef and cheese tacos. He didn't eat fruits or vegetables. He didn't eat any meat except for beef. He'd eat chocolate and ice cream and stuff though. And he was SO bad at checking labels and he had a few allergic reactions while we lived together. One time he had to be rushed to the hospital and spent a week in because he had such a bad reaction.\n\nKathleen's super picky too. I can't remember all the stuff she wouldn't eat but it included any kind of fish, any kind of potato, rice, pasta, bread and stuff like that. \n\nThis left us in a really weird position when my dad wanted to order takeout or take us out to eat.

I'm a bit nosy so I checked around, thinking maybe one of the electronics was short wiring, or something. IDK. I checked everywhere, eventually realizing the smell was the worst in the trash. I found a bunch of burnt note cards. I tried to decipher the two most legible and one shows what looks like a map? There's two names, Keith or Koith and Misha. it clearly says 28 yr trophy on the K card and i think 17 yr on the misha card.\n\nMy flatmate has been extremely cold and distant the last few months. At first, he was super friendly but it's been like living with a ghost recently. We aren't friends. I strictly know him via the AD I responded to when looking for this spot...He works at a grocery store.\n\nPlease tell im overreacting here. ",

So never buy them at an orignal price unless need mo na talaga gamitin.\n\nIf you are a UniqLord (lol, Uniqlo addict) like me who just buy them kapag bored, download the app and watch the prices ng mga plan mong item. Wait mo magsale, under Limited Offers, or under Sale (clearance items) tab. For sure, kahit anong item yan magsasale ng at least 200 pesos. Sometimes even half the original price kapag di mabenta yung product\n\nThat's why medyo nasasayangan ako sa mga first time buyers who bought their pants for 1990, when I can score them for 1490 or 990.\n\nI even bought sale items na di ko pa nagagamit then after a few days or weeks, sale ulit at a lower price. [Edit] To the point na wala pang 30 days, and pwede ko pang iexchange sa ibang item yung product, then buy again the item at a lower price.",

(Samsung S22 Ultra) I hadused it for 3 yrs mostly work related stuff..  After i got a new phone i had left the old one in the drawer... I rarley clicked pics n videos.. n  Honestly I\u2019m not tech-savvy at all\u2026 since it was a gift to me i didnt go exploring the phone features.. even we end up buying phones loaded with features and hardly use any of them...\n\nThis is the first thing he sends me on his way home... a video and photo of a plane at the airport... he wrote he can read the registration of the aircraft... The plane was sooo far away you could barely see it with your eyes\u2026 and he somehow zoomed in and clicked it a photo...  i had never tried this while i had the phone...\n\nNow I\u2019m wondering\u2026 am I the only one who buys phones and barely uses 20% of their features?",

There's a lot to do including restoring the old Matai native hardwood floors but we have young kids so we've carpeted for more bounce and warmth. \n\nIt's pretty typical for villas in NZ to have corrugated iron roofing and a central hallway through the house with rooms off that either side. The house is also built from native timber, including the sash windows. You could never build a house out of Matai these days so it makes these houses even more special. \n\nIt's cold as fuck and needs a lot of work but we love it, and we'd love to hear what you think!",

I filled out forms, left my address, numbers and email. I also wrote in the margin that I would love updates and mentioned her fans as well as left my reddit post info (perhaps overkill).
