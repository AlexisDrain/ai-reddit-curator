More recently I have started studying again which has been pivotal for my mental health/self worth and has enabled me to work on turning my life around, set boubdaries with others etc. No more self sabotage.

Who would choose such a thing? Who would want to listen to that nail on a chalkboard? \n\nBut this new voice actress, whomever she is? She sounds just like the old Paimon, if Corina had screech-removal surgery. It's silly, it's bratty, but it's soothing and wispy, just like the elegant fairy she was meant to be. I'm actually finding myself picking the kinder dialogue options when talking to her now, as I'm hating her less and less with each passing day.\n\nI'm so happy right now, this is like a dream come true. I love this new version of her, and I love this new actress. I hope she gets her name credited soon, because she deserves it.",

I thought he was funny and seemed sweet through our conversations. We talked frequently and I eventually gave him my number. He recently asked me out on our first date at some fancy restaurant and the date was going very well until he dropped my off at my house. \n\nWhen we got there he basically tried to invite himself inside by saying that we could continue the date and have a few drinks inside. I was like wtf because this was the first date and I don't do that type of stuff and he was overly pushy about it which made me uncomfortable and unsure if going on this date was a good idea. \n\nI eventually got him to go by saying I was feeling tired and that I had to get up early tomorrow for my morning shift, which wasn't a lie. \n\nThe next morning I had woken up to these weird ass texts from him early in the morning. It genuinely creeped me ...",

Trains can efficiently move large quantities of cargo and passengers across vast distances. However, your colony must pay the upfront cost of labor-intensive rail infrastructure to gain the long-term benefits of massive cargo capacity and significant fuel efficiency. This mod aims to offer trains as an early industrial vehicle option while still remaining relevant in mid-to-late game colonies as a fuel efficient way to meet bulk trading and transportation needs.\n\n[Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3530446424)",

It could just be \"guy picks up sword one day and goes I wanna adventure.\" It is his first character.\n\n\nHe makes a pretty detailed backstory about his character being a runaway slave from Drow slavers from the Underdark, and how he found a surface entrance that led him to the city of Baldur's Gate where he lived since then. (In session 0, we explained what the Underdark and how dark elves worked to him since my homebrew campaign would take place there.) \n\n\nWe began the actual game with an introduction to the Flaming Fist.
