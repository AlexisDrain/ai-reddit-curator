"selftext": " We\u2019ve been dating for about six months. This happened yesterday, on a crowded train - I had a seat, and he was standing by the door. A man in his mid-20s, who didn\u2019t have a seat either, had a heavy bag and asked if he could place it under the seat. I said sure, so i slid it behind my legs, he thanked me, and I smiled. After that, he kept staring at me, but I ignored it. I had my earbuds in and was reading my book, just doing my own thing.\n\nWe were literally still in our school uniforms. I\u2019m 16F, he\u2019s 18M. We\u2019re in the same grade because my teacher made me skip a year when I was younger, and he joined school a bit late\n\nI'm just more confused than anything, i still can't believe this is an argument someone can have \n",

The current fourth wave of feminism in particular is focused on sexual misconduct, consent, women's bodily autonomy, and fighting for these advancements for ALL women which includes LGBTQ+ women.

They use it like a PR shield cause what company is going to want to oppose a \"feminist organization\". \n\n  \nJust needed to vent cause I hate how many media outlets are referring to them as a feminist group despite the actual feminist movement being very sex positive and extremely supportive of sex workers.\n\n  \nFourth wave Feminism - [https://www.womenshistory.org/exhibits/feminism-fourth-wave](https://www.womenshistory.org/exhibits/feminism-fourth-wave)\n\nCollective Shout (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective\\_Shout) is affiliated with multipl...",

It showed what collective willpower can achieve when people rally behind a cause that feels personal and sacred. The movement wasn\u2019t just about an animal; it was about identity, belonging, and a perceived violation of cultural faith.\n\nBut it also raises a tough question, what if we showed this same intensity and unity against the deeper, more damaging problems that plague our society every day? Corruption, casteism, gender inequality, political hypocrisy,  these rot us from within, yet rarely evoke such overwhelming and sustained action. Why are our priorities always so skewed? When do we march for justice that isn\u2019t wrapped in religion or emotion, but simply in the name of basic human dignity?\n\nVideo courtesy- Vibes of the people.",

"selftext": "About three years ago I was at an event in downtown Cairo for work. While there were a bunch of kittens running around trying to get food from anyone, this one tried to climb under my shirt and snuggle into me. Over the next two days she kept finding me in the crowd and ending up in my lap, and I'd feed her little scraps and give her water. On the last day I got ahold of a great shelter (Safe Haven Egypt if anyone wants to look them up) that adopts street cats out internationally, put the cat in an empty box I got off of the street, and took an hour and a half Uber ride to the shelter to drop her off. They did the vet work and paperwork to get her travel ready, and about two months later I went back to Egypt to pick her up and bring her to the US.\n\nSecond picture is her today. She's never far from me - she sleeps against me every night, sits by me on the couch for TV time, and screams at the bathroom door every morning until I let her in for my showering time.",

The overcast, foggy mornings- followed by 60-70 degree days- in conjunction with the most beautiful scenery I have ever seen is not to be taken lightly. You quite literally live in the most beautiful city, and area I have ever encountered. \n\nI can without a doubt tell you that, Battery Spencer in Sausalito looking back at SF is the most alive I have ever felt.

He bullied me for almost my entire secondary school life, him and his friends made my life miserable for most my secondary school life. I had no friends,no one to talk to, they made me do embarrassing things to make me lose self worth, they beat me up,harassed me online and started a hate campaign on me, just cause i was different from them. I was too afraid to talk to someone under the fear him and his \u201cgang\u201d would beat me up.I decided to do something to screw him over by giving him a disappearing ink pen for N levels. I raided his bag and threw his pencil case away, i then put the pen in his bag for him to find it and use it.\nI hope this will screw him over.\ntldr; i got bullied and i wanted to screw him over",

Lahat ng kapatid ko nakalibot na sa ibang bansa like Singapore, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, US, and UK, including yung bunso namin na 12 years younger sakin. Ako for some reason, either busy or wala lang budget. Pero dahil wedding ng Ate ko sa UK, I would not miss it for the world so I had to go. Kahit sobrang linis ng passport ko and hindi kami nakapagapply as a family, pinilit ko talaga. Akala ng family ko di ako makakapunta pero thankfully, naapprove ako on my second application.\n\nDahil late ako naapprove, nauna na family ko pumunta ng UK, while I had to go solo haha. Ang saya lang kasi nakapunta kaming lahat and we were able to spend time, especially now na may kanya-kanyang buhay na kaming magkakapatid. I also got to experience a different culture. And ibang-iba rin talaga. Makikita mo how far behind we are, considering na first-world naman kasi sila. Dati naiintimidate ako ...",

"selftext": "A while ago I posted my torn up copy of the Oblivion game guide, which my brother first got in 2005. It was used many, many times and fell into pretty bad disrepair. It eventually came to me, and has been in storage for years. I decided to fix it up and researched a leather binding guide, and found some leather.\n\nI had a good idea how to construct it, but my leather was a little too short and I didn\u2019t measure the spine correctly, so I hit a snag. I had to rip it apart and make a new spine, and did some patchwork on the back. It\u2019s not very pretty to look at so I didn\u2019t include any glamour shots lol. I really love it, I think I did a good job. It still needs a tiny bit of weathering and some gold leaf, which I think will really make it look magical \ud83e\udd29 \n\nI\u2019m planning on giving it to my brother when I see him at the end of the month, as a belated birthday gift. I\u2019m super excited to give it to him, and a touch sad it\u2019s going to leave me \ud83e\udd79\ud83e\udd79\ud83e\udd79",
