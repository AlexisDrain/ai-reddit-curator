This was after we just had a newborn son who turned 5 months old last week. \n\nI\u2019m at a loss for words and honestly don\u2019t know what to do. Def getting a gym membership lmao but yeah. Four years and a family down the drain because she couldn\u2019t communicate with me and make me aware that she was losing interest. \n\nIt just hurts bc it feels like I was trying so hard to provide a happy home and was so excited to raise our son together only for this to happen. We\u2019re currently dealing with so much and this was the cherry on top. ",
