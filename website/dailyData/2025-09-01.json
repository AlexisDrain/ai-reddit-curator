I feed her every night and tonight was a special night because it\u2019s the first time she let me sit on the ground and stay with her while she ate. Then when she was done and the bowl was empty she didn\u2019t run away. She sat next to me and stayed for a while and groomed herself. She doesn\u2019t trust me to touch her but likes listening to me talk. The plan is to eventually catch her and bring her to the vet to get all fixed up. I would like to keep her. I am curious though, why does she look like that? Did a person do that to her? Or is it a birth defect? Her eyelids are pulled back almost and her ears are like gone.",
