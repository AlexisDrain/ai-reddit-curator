She was not even supposed to be in the apartment until Tuesday yet she thinks I could see into the future, see she's in town and on a date, predict she'll bring him home afterwards and bake cookies to sabotage her date.   \n  \nIt's not like I was prancing around them in my underwear baking cookies, there were just some  cookies cooling on an oven rack in the kitchen while I sat in my bedroom. We have never had a fight about guys before, her and my type are polar opposites anyway and I've never met a date or bf of her before.  \n  \nIn my mind this is completely insane but a friend (also American) said I should not \"act like a tradwife\" when there's another male around because that can come off as being a \"pickme\".
