"selftext": "In 2021 I was living in a cabin in the woods of east GA and my cat Orville would sit by the window yowling every night at this little guy who was too scared to come close. I started leaving food out, and on a cold and stormy February night he finally let me get close enough to pet him, and he was SUCH a sweetie. I let him inside the cabin (much to Orville\u2019s chagrin), and he continued to be such a nice little guy. I could see that he was covered in bite/claw wounds, his ear was half bitten off, his fur was matted and his face was swollen. I took him that night to an emergency care vet and had him assessed and treated. He hadn\u2019t been neutered and he had to be shaved down to get rid of all the mats. \n\nI spent a few months nursing him back to health, got him neutered, and slowly introduced him to Orville (they are inseparable now). \n\nNow 4 years later Finnegan is a healthy, happy, thriving city cat who loves to snuggle, headbutt, and lounge around in the sun.",
