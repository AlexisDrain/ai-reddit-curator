My parents talked to the bank and they're unable to refund or hold the payment because it's already deposited. Unfortunately we're just going to have to move on.\n\nThe night I made the post, I got a message from a local Redditor asking if they could see the lawn in person. Long story short, they're a professional landscaper. They not only took the time to explain everything wrong with the installation (ex: the turf is actually meant for balconies) but also removed and reinstalled the turf free of charge! He declined payment multiple times but had a beer with my father which he really appreciated. I won't post his information on Reddit, but my parents have made posts in all their Facebook groups and we will be recommending him forever.\n\nOriginal Post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/landscaping/comments/1p5y03f/paid\\_3000\\_for\\_this\\_artificial\\_lawn\\_any\\_fixing\\_this/]...",

Without knowing.\n\nOur entire friend group knew, she was introducing people to me as her girlfriend, rightfully so. The whole time I just thought we were extremely close best friends.\n\nI was talking with another one of our friends earlier, and I brought up my girlfriend, who I will call Mina. I said that I love how close we are, and just talked about how much I love our friendship. My friend literally froze, I knew I had said something wrong, I just didn't know what. She quickly left the room to, I assume, text our friend group.\n\nI get a call from Mina about five minutes later, asking me about what I was talking about. So I told her, I love our friendship, and I love how affectionate we were able to be without it being weird. She went silent, and then said she would be over soon.\n\nSkip to her showing up, and she sits down next to me, and breaks the news to me that we have b...",

He'd walk up to the counter, ask something stupid like what size the medium is, and then conveniently just order while he was already up there.\n\nHe did this at least four times that I witnessed. Nobody ever called him out because, you know, confrontation before coffee isn't worth it.\n\nSo I started playing the same game. Whenever I'd see him walk in and start heading toward the counter with his \"I have a question\" routine, I'd quickly step out of line and beat him to it. Then I'd ask the most annoying, time-consuming questions possible.\n\n\"What's the difference between a latte and a cappuccino again?\"\n\n\"Do you have oat milk? What about almond? Soy? Which one froths better?\"\n\n\"Can you explain your whole pastry selection?\"\n\nAnd then I'd say \"Oh actually, l...",
