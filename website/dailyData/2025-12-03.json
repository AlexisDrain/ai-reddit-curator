We will work with him on the next step of his career. Chris is a legendary Clipper who has had a historic career. I want to make one thing very clear. No one is blaming Chris for our underperformance. I accept responsibility for the record we have right now. There are a lot of reasons why we\u2019ve struggled. We\u2019re grateful for the impact Chris has made on the franchise.\u201d\n\n[Source](https://www.threads.com/@chrisbhaynesnba/post/DRyyk-xlFpE?xmt=AQF0KKDtevBR1S25kX1yili7iNnZSwpJwEIkdGiqYdWyKc4_7oB7h4nepU6FtNCW_LM...",

"selftext": "I saw in the news today that Tarantino said *There Will Be Blood* isn\u2019t his favorite film of the 21st century because *\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be a 2-hander, but Dano is weak sauce, man\u2026 He\u2019s just such a weak, weak, uninteresting guy. The weakest fucking actor in SAG.\u201d*\n\nHonestly, I thought this was an incredibly classless thing for Tarantino to say. First of all, I actually thought Dano was great in the film  he genuinely made me *hate* the character, and when an actor manages that, it usually means they\u2019re doing a damn good job. And from what I\u2019ve read, Dano barely had any time to prepare for the role anyway.\n\nTarantino was one of my favorite directors from the 90s  *Pulp Fiction* is in my top 25 movies ever  but the truth is, as an actor he\u2019s pretty weak himself. Whenever he shows up on screen, he sticks out in all the wrong ways. Even in *Django*, every line he delivers feels forced and unnatural.\n\nToday I lost a lot of respect for Tarantino.",
