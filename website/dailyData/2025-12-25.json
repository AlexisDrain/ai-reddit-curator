"selftext": "2 years ago, we let my 7 year old cat, which I had since I was 9 years old, outside as we usually did, and sadly he did not return. The first couple months I was scared to leave our apartment alone or to sleep as I was afraid he'd return with no one to let him inside. It wasn't until around the one year mark I'd finally lost hope and accepted he was gone. That changed until around last Tuesday, before the holidays, that my mom had received a text from a veterinary clinic 30 minutes away had found our cat and scanned his chip, alerting us right away. We simply could not believe that our boy had been found after 2 years, but the second I saw his missing front tooth, I knew it was him. Our family was given a Christmas miracle, and now we're still cherishing these moments with him as he gets readjusted to his home again \u2764\ufe0f",

Then she enjoys chatting, and then asking 15 minutes later what's going on in the movie. Or when I'm doing my annual Vincent Price marathon in October, call them stupid old movies. The biggest cardinal sin are the distractions, \"hey can you get me some milk?\" \"run to the kitchen and get me a snack\" etc.\n\nWhen i watch a movie that's what I'm doing, I'm watching a movie. No phones, no laptops, no tablets. All the while paying attention to the movie and not 15 other things.\n\nSo if there's a movie I want to see and I know she won't be interested I wait for her to go to bed then make some popcorn and watch a good movie, by myself with no distractions.\n\nAfter I type this and hit post I'm making som...",
