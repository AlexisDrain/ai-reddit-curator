This is what a sun damaged scalp looks like after treatment with Efudex, a topical chemotherapy for precancerous and cancerous cells. It feels like it looks, painful and insanely itchy. I also just had a basal cell carcinoma cut out behind my ear. The chemo only affects the precancerous and cancerous cells. So I clearly have a lot of damage. Just wanted to share in the hopes you will take good care of the skin up there. \u270c\ufe0f",
