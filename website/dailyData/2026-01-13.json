"selftext": "Took a long time, initially I was going to do everything by purchasing furniture but the layout of my apartment is kind of awkward and un-ideal. Only option was to do custom furniture to really maximize things. So had to learn basic woodworking and decided to build everything myself. I started off with basic equipment I bought myself at home depot, including a small job site table saw and 2x4s. Repurposed that walk in closet into a longer desk. Eventually had to get a membership at a local woodworking shop to build the kitchen island as that was a whole new thing and was way too complicated to do at home.\n\nSuper long journey but overall so happy with how things turned out!\n\nEDIT: Here are some requested night time shots:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/6DXbL94](https://imgur.com/a/6DXbL94)",
