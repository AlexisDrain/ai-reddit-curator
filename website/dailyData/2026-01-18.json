My parents were over at the time and they asked the kids why they were upset. The kids told on me for punishing them.

They insisted that they were in the right. I was tired of their bullshit by this point so I asked them if they thought their form of punishment was better. They quickly shut up. \n\nI called my kids over and asked them if I was being too hard on them. They said yes. I asked them if they wanted to try the kind of punishment I got at their age.

I managed to buy beddings, pillows and even curtains! I also got a small storage box that I could use as a chair so I wont have to just be constantly laying down! \n\nStill far from a comfortable living situation but its slowly getting better! The room has a very poor ventilation and I can\u2019t afford to buy an oscillating fan or an air-conditioner so its very humid and Im often covered in sweat waking up. \n\nFor any working pet parent, how can i be sure that he\u2019s comfortable while Im working and in school? I cant get him toys yet to keep him entertained, but I walk him for an hour to tired him out before I leave for school too. And lastly, anyone knows any cheaper alternative than royal canin? Once his dog food runs out I\u2019m afraid I wont afford the same brand.",
