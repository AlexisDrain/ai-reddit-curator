"title": "After having a dog for 6 years, we found out she had (almost) no brain.",
"selftext": "We\u2019d had this dog 6 years, she\u2019d had a litter of puppies, and lived a normal life (although we always noticed she was a little off). She had a seizure, so we took her to the vet. They ran labs and noticed her sodium was extremely low and kept her overnight. She was then sent to UC Davis where the vets were surprised she could walk based on her labs. After days of testing they did an MRI and discovered she had hydrocephalus and 95% of her brain cavity was fluid. All of the white you see in the MRI was fluid. Second picture is a comparison to a \u201cnormal\u201d dog.\n\nAnd her low sodium levels were her body\u2019s way of keeping her brain in some form of homeostasis. They sent her home with instructions to provide lots of water and that was it. She lived until 12 when she started having regular seizures and we had to say goodbye.\n\nOur weirdo medical miracle \ud83e\ude77\ud83d\udc3e",
