The colour palettes, shading techniques and line work has changed a lot since vision loss, as my left eye was actually my strongest one. \nI also struggle to cook, due to the same issue with depth perception and slicing stuff - don't want to lose a finger too lmaoo.\nI would actually love to do a video about the difference in my art before and after vision loss!\n\nBut as for how I lost the eye,  it was an unfortunate situation due to glaucoma caused by a medical error tha...",

In Community, multiple scenes throughout the show, as well as the the shows original website character bios and Dan Harmon explicitly stating it in an AMA, show that Britta was molested as child at one of her birthday parties by a man in a dinosaur costume. \n\nIt's only mentioned a few times in the actual show, and it's always easy to not comprehend because it's so brief. It does however, make her wearing a dinosaur costume to Halloween... Really sad. \n\n2.) Scott Pilgrim vs The World. When prepping for their roles, a lot of the actors were given 5 secrets about their characters by the comic's creator Bryan Lee O'Malley. Most were just stuff that was going to be in the future issues of the comic, but Mary Elizabeth Winstead got a big one about Ramona. She had a brother that died in a car crash. The entire movie she wears his shoelace around her neck to remember him by. This fact isn't brought up in any Scott Pilgrim media, but she is always wearing the shoelace if you look and it ...",

For context I've been working retail for years barely scraping by while drowning in student loans and living paycheck to paycheck. Used to visit my sister every week because honestly her place was warmer than my crappy apartment and she always had food. Turns out those visits meant everything to her because she left me the house while my engineer brother who makes 380k got nothing. Now I can actually build some wealth instead of throwing money at rent forever. Brother is pissed and wants me to take out loans to give him half but honestly after years of eating ramen and stressing about bills I'm keeping what sister wanted me to have. Sometimes the universe throws you a bone when you least expect it.\n\n  \nI have no one else to tell. I'm sorry if this comes off as bragging :(",
